This project stores experimental code that isn't quite ready for prime time or code meant strictly 
for use by developers and/or power users for research or testing purposes only. Anything below 
TRL5 [1] should be put in this project, as well as all test code for the classes in this project.
Classes in this project are expected to be tested but the testing rigor may not necessarily be up to 
the same standards as the tests added to hoot-core-test which test the hoot-core library. Note: This 
project probably should be disabled by default but currently is not.

1. TRL5 - Module and/or subsystem validation in a relevant environment
