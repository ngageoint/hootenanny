# -------------------------------------------------
# The Hoot R&D project is a place to store experimental code that isn't quite ready for prime time
# or code meant strictly for use by developers and/or power users for research or testing purposes
# only.  Anything below TRL5 [1] should be put in this project, as well as all test code for the
# classes in this project. This project is disabled by default which should help avoid introducing
# bugs into the core while experimenting (TODO: this isn't currently true, but needs to be).
