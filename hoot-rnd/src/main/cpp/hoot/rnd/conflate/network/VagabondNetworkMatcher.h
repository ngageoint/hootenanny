/**
 * Start a random location in one of the networks, then recursively traverse the graph starting at
 * that location. At each hop in the graph, determine which edges could have been used in the
 * corresponding network and where they would lead. If there is no way to get there while
 * maintaining the Hausdorff distance, then it is a dead end. Otherwise, assign it a portion of the
 * total weight that the vagrant has and repeat.
 *
 * Backtracking is allowed.
 *
 * To make the terminology a little more precise, the term link will refer to a link from one
 * pair of edges to another pair of edges.
 *
 * This has many parallels to PageRank -- a partial inspiration.
 *
 * This approach has some neat benefits. It will find multiple possible solutions at one time at
 * which point an optimization approach such as Linear Programming could be used to create a final
 * solution. It also appears as though it isn't really suffering from a local maxima, but that
 * also leads to a bit of indecision.
 *
 * One notable benefit to this approach is that it is highly scalable. A hadoop implemenation
 * is very feasible, but would be outside the existing parallel conflation code.
 *
 * The biggest disadvantage as this implementation stands now is that supporting subgraphs can be
 * created where the model will stagnate with each subgraph coming to its own internal solution, but
 * the subgraph's do not interact and so the solution never converges to a meaningful solution.
 * I've been calling these subgraphs "ghost graphs".
