/**
 * The OsmNetwork represents major transportational vertices and edges in the map. These may or
 * may not have a one to one correlation with nodes, ways and relations. For instance, a vertex
 * may represent all the ways and nodes in a roundabout, or simply the node at a four way stop.
 * Though the former has yet to be implemented (as of 2016-07-06).
 *
 * Why not use boost graphs? Well, I used them for the OsmSchema implementation and in my opinion
 * it is write-once read-never code. While it is likely very efficient it is very difficult to
 * write and understand.
 *
 * Network vs. Graph - Typically I think of graph analysis when writing applications, however in
 * GIS paralance network is more common. I'm just trying to fit in.
 *
 * It is assumed that after the network is created the Network*Ptrs will not change. Changing them
 * will result in undefined behaviour.
