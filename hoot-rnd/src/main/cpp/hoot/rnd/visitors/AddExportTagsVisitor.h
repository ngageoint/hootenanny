/**
 * Historically the tags for export have been added in the OsmMapWriter code. This creates
 * duplicate code, is inconsistent and difficult to maintain/use. The intent of this visitor is
 * to centralize the creation of these tags. This comes at the cost of cloning every element during
 * the export/write operation (to avoid modifying the input element), but I think it is likely
 * worth the cost.
 *
 * @todo refactor all existing writers to use this visitor.
