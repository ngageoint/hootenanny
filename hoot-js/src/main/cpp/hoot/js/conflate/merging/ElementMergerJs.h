/**
 * Merges two or more elements based on their feature type, accepting a nodejs map as input.
 *
 * This class has been tested mostly against the Reference Conflation workflow. Its possible it may
 * need modifications to support other worfklows.
 *
 * This class should be used with a data reader that uses the element source IDs and uses a default
 * status of Unknown1.
 *
 * This class will handle either the case where a valid map is passed in with all constituent
 * elements (way nodes, relation members) or an invalid map passed in without the constituent
 * elements. It can do this because only the parent elements are needed for actual merging. The
 * invalid map input case is necessary b/c the UI sends the server only the features that need
 * merging and then handles removing any constituent features itself after the merge with a call to
 * the OSM services. Technically, we have no known client code sending in valid maps with
 * constituent features for merging at this time, but since that could change, and its easy to
 * support both.
 *
 * This class has a mix of functionality where the merging is done by hoot-js calls into generic
 * scripts and functionality where the merging is done strictly by hoot-core code. Arguably, you
 * could do all the merging via hoot-core C++ code which would make the workflow simpler, the code
 * easier to read, and avoid unnecessary calls out to Javascript. However, since the generic
 * scripts have their own merge functions already defined that users may want to customize, for
 * consistency's sake it makes more sense to use this hybrid approach.
 *
 * The original merger only merged POIs and supported many into one merging. Many into one merging
 * is supported for all feature types except POI to Polygon and rail. However, don't actually think
 * many-to-one merging is actually used by any clients and that all merging is done as one feature
 * into one other feature. So, this code and supporting tests could probably be simplified by
 * removing support for many into one merging if it is not being utilized.
 *
 * Update translations/ElementMergeServer.MD and the supported feature types error message if you
 * add any feature types to the merging process.
