# Installing Vagrant

To download Vagrant for supported platforms, see [here](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)

# Installing VirtualBox

If choosing VirtualBox as your virtualization provider, see [here](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads).  

You may have to enable hardware virtualization extensions in your BIOS before using it.

If running on Ubuntu, you may have to install a newer version of VirtualBox than what is available in the public repositories in order for it to work correctly with Vagrant.

# Setting up Hootennany with Vagrant & VirtualBox

Once Vagrant has been installed, you can start an environment by checking out the hoot code, then changing to the directory which contains the Vagrantfile by typing:

    # Windows users will need to uncomment the line ending configuration option.
    git clone git@github.com:ngageoint/hootenanny.git hoot #--config core.autocrlf=input
    cd hoot
    git submodule init
    git submodule update
    vagrant up

# Other Virtualization Providers

If you would like to use Parallels instead of VirtualBox, please run the following command:
```
vagrant up --provider=parallels
```
Please note that this requires the Parallels Vagrant plugin, which can be installed:
```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-parallels
```

Similarly, if you would like to use VMware Workstation instead of VirtualBox, please run the following command:
```
vagrant up --provider vmware_workstation
```
Please note that this requires the VMware Vagrant plugin, which can be installed:
```
vagrant plugin install vagrant-vmware-workstation
```

# *On Windows hosts,*

* Windows hosts will also have to create a symlink that's in the git repo, but seems to be treated as a file when cloning to windows.

    `vagrant ssh`
    `cd hoot`

# Vagrant Provisioning

The initialization of the vagrant vm will take about an hour to download required software from the internet and set it up as a running system. Once it is complete, uncomment the `#, group: "tomcat6"` portion of the in Vagrantfile to allow the webapp to write to shared folders.

    # argument is a set of non-required options.
    config.vm.synced_folder ".", "/home/vagrant/hoot", group: "tomcat6", mount_options: ["dmode=775,fmode=775"]
    # UNCOMMENT group after inital provisioning, then run vagrant reload

Then issue the reload command for the changes to take effect on the vm:

    vagrant reload

You should be able to log into the running VM by typing:

    vagrant ssh

Within this login shell, you can build the code, run the server or the tests. For example, to run the tests:

    vagrant ssh
    cd hoot
    source ./SetupEnv.sh
    scripts/CopyWebAppsToTomcat.sh
    make -sj$(nproc) test-all

# Using Hootenanny

To access the web pages you access the site in your [local Chrome browser](http://localhost:8888/hootenanny-id).

To run hoot from commandline

    vagrant ssh
    cd hoot
    source ./SetupEnv.sh
    hoot help

If you've updated the code, you must connect to the vm via ssh to build and redeploy to Tomcat:

    vagrant ssh
    cd hoot
    source ./SetupEnv.sh
    make -sj$(nproc)
    scripts/CopyWebAppsToTomcat.sh
