[[diff]]
== diff

=== Description

The +diff+ command checks to see if maps are essentially the same. 

It returns 0 if they are the same or 1 if they differ significantly. If they differ significantly, warnings will be 
printed with more information. It can also compare .osc changeset files and directories. Directories will load into 
on `<osmChange>` file to be compared to the other file/directory.

* +input2+          - Input 2; may be any supported input format (e.g. .osm file).
* +--ignore-uuid+   - Ignore UUID's in the map comparison
* +--use-datetime+  - Do not ignore source:datetime & source:ingest:datetime
* +--error-limit+   - Increase the compare error limit from the defaule value of 10
