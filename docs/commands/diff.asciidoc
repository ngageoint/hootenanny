=== Description

The +diff+ command checks to see if maps are essentially the same. It returns 0 if they are the same or 1 if they differ
significantly. If they differ significantly, warnings will be printed with more information.  Can also compare .osc changeset
files and directories.  Directories will load into on `<osmChange>` file to be compared to the other file/directory.

* +--ignore-uuid+   - Ignore UUID's in the map comparison
* +--use-datetime+  - Do not ignore source:datetime & source:ingest:datetime
* +--error-limit+   - Increase the compare error limit from the defaule value of 10
