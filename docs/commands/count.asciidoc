[[count]]
== count

=== Description

The +count+ command displays a count of the number of features in a map, allowing for optional filtering with criteria.

* +inputs+         - One or more inputs; may be any supported input format (e.g. .osm file); specify multiple inputs 
                     by separating them with a semicolon and surrounding them with quotes.
* +criteria+       - (optional) Filtering criteria; May be one or more class names inheriting from `ElementCriterion` 
                     delimited with a semicolon and surrounded by quotes. By default, multiple criteria are logically 
                     OR'd together. Set the `element.counter.chain.element.criteria` option to true to have the 
                     criteria logically AND'd together. The criteria can be negated with the option 
                     `element.criteria.negate`. Use the +info --operators+ command to obtain a list of available criteria.
* +--all-elements+ - The default behavior is to only count features. Features are defined as elements with at least 
                     one information tag, whereas elements have no tag requirements. Activating this option causes the 
                     command to consider all elements regardless of whether they have any information tags. The `criteria`
                     parameter may prevent all elements from actually being parsed, however.
