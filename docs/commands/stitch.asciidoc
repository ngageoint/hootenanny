[[stitch]]
== stitch

=== Description

The `stitch` command stitches two adjacent maps. 

It reads in tile boundaries, uses them to process a map, and writes out multiple maps. One map is written for each tile in 
the tile boundary containing only the elements that reside within that boundary. For elements that span multiple boundaries, 
the geospatial envelope of the element is compared to all tiles it intersects and they are stored in the one that contains the 
highest percentage of overlap.
