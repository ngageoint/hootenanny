[[changeset-derive-replacement]]
== changeset-derive-replacement

=== Description

The +changeset-derive-replacement+ command creates an OSM changeset file that represents the difference between two OSM datasets within a 
specified bounds, where the data from the secondary input dataset replaces data in the reference dataset. The command can be configured to
replace all reference data within the specified bounds or only reference data in areas where the reference and secondary data overlap. 
Additional filtering may be applied to the secondary input to control which types of features from it are added to the output.
 
The changeset derivation algorithm avoids unnecessary clipping of features (e.g. buildings crossing the specified bounds) and stitches up 
areas where features must be clipped (e.g. roads crossing the specified bounds). The output changeset file can be applied directly to an 
OSM API database or the Rails Port API with the  +changeset-apply+ command. Generally, the reference data is sourced from an authoritative 
data store, like an OSM API database, and the secondary can be any type of data. Element IDs for the first input dataset (reference data) are 
retained and treated as data resident in an authoritative data store. Element IDs for the second input dataset (secondary data) are not retained 
and treated as completely new data. 

* +input1+                       - Reference input with features to replace; may be any supported input format that supports bounded reading 
                                   (e.g. OSM file). See the "Bounds Handling" section for more detail.
* +input2+                       - Secondary input with the features used for replacement; may be any supported input format that supports 
                                   bounded reading (e.g. OSM file). See the "Bounds Handling" section for more detail.
* +bounds+                       - Comma delimited bounds: minx,miny,maxx,maxy; e.g. "-71.4698,42.4866,-71.4657,42.4902"
* +output+                       - Output location; must be an .osc or .osc.sql file.
* +osmApiDatabaseUrl+            - Target OSM API database the changeset is to be applied to.  Used to maintain element ID continuity with a 
                                   particular database instance when generating SQL changesets only (.osc.sql).
* +--full-replacement+           - Determines how much of the reference data is replaced. The default behavior replaces reference feature with
                                   overlap with secondary features only. See the  "Bounds Handling" section for more detail.
* +--strict-bounds+              - Determines how strict the interpretation of the specified bounds is during feature replacement. The default
                                   behavior involves a lenient bounds interpretation. See the  "Bounds Handling" section for more detail.
* +--geometry-filters+           - Optional criteria used to determine the geometry type of the features that are replaced in the reference 
                                   dataset. The default behavior is to replace features of any geometry type. See the "Geometry Filtering" 
                                   section for more detail.
* +--replacement-filters+        - Optional filtering criteria beyond what is specified in --geometry-filters for determining which secondary 
                                   dataset features are used as replacement features. See the "Replacement Filtering" section for more detail.
* +--chain-replacement-filters+  - Determines how the criteria specified in --replacement-filters are applied. See the "Replacement Filtering" 
                                   section for more detail.
* +--replacement-filter-options+ - Optional configuration options for the filters specified in --replacement-filters. See the 
                                   "Replacement Filtering" section for more detail.
* +--stats+                      - Stats flag, when turned on a table of create, modify, delete for each of the types node, way, relation (only 
                                   valid for .osc output files)
* +--write-bounds+               - If the `convert.bounding.box` configuration option is specified, optionally outputs a file containing the 
                                   input bounds. The location of the file is controlled via the `bounds.output.file` configuration option.

=== Bounds Handling

All inputs must support bounded reading. To list the Hootenanny input formats that support bounded reading:
-----
hoot info --formats --input-bounded
-----

Unless the reference data is being read from a direct connection to an OSM API database (osmapidb://), reference input datasets containing 
linear data should be slightly larger than the replacement AOI, so as not to drop linear features in the changeset output 
(osmapidb:// reference inputs handle this issue automatically).

==== Full vs Overlapping Only Replacement

If +--full-replacement+ option is absent, reference features inside the specified bounds will only be replaced if the area they cover intersects 
with the area covered by secondary features. The covered area is determined by an Alpha Shape. If the +--full-replacement+ option is present,
all reference features within the specified bounds will be removed.

Full replacement works well with points and polygons (e.g. POIs and buildings) when you absolutely do not want any of the original reference 
data left in an AOI. If there are large gaps across the AOI between the reference and secondary data, you may want to do an overlapping only 
replacement to enable continuity of the data across the AOI.

Full replacement may not work well with linear data in certain circumstances with the strict bounds interpretation (e.g. roads), as it may end 
up leaving a large enough gap between the reference and secondary data that the data cannot easily be joined back together in the output.

==== Strict Bounds Handling

The following describes how the specified bounds is interpreted by the command when the +--strict-bounds+ option is present.

===== Points

* Only reference features completely inside the specified bounds and overlapping with the combined shape of the secondary features will be 
  replaced.
* No secondary feature lying on or outside the specified bounds will be included in the output.

===== Lines

* Only reference features overlapping with the combined shape of the secondary features will be replaced.
* No reference feature crossing the specified bounds will be modified outside of the bounds. Reference features may be split at the specified 
  bounds.
* No parts of secondary features crossing the specified bounds will be included in the output.

===== Polygons

* Only reference features overlapping with the combined shape of the secondary features will be replaced.
* No reference features crossing the specified bounds will be modified.
* No secondary features crossing the specified bounds will be included in the output.

==== Lenient Bounds Handling

The following describes how the specified bounds is interpreted by the command when the +--strict-bounds+ bounds option is absent.

===== Points

N/A - Point bounds relationships are only handled in a strict fashion.

===== Lines

* Only reference features overlapping with the combined shape of the secondary features will be replaced.
* Reference features crossing the specified bounds will be completely replaced by secondary features.

===== Polygons

* Only reference features overlapping with the combined shape of the secondary features will be replaced.
* Reference features crossing the specified bounds may be modified. They will not be split, and will only be conflated with secondary features.
* Secondary features crossing the specified bounds may be included unmodified in the output or conflated with reference features.

=== Filtering

==== Geometry Filtering

The command option, --geometry-filters, controls feature filtering by geometry type. One or more element criterion class names associated with 
a geometry type can be used to determine the geometry type of the features that are replaced in the reference dataset . The criteria specified 
must be geometry type criteria (e.g. "hoot::BuildingCriterion" or "hoot::PointCriteron"). 

To see a list of valid geometry type criteria for use as a feature filter:
-----
hoot info --geometry-type-criteria
-----

A feature may pass the geometry filter by satisfying any one of the individual specified filters. From the command line, combine multiple 
criteria with a semicolon and surround the entire value string with quotes.  If no filter is specified, features of all geometry types within 
the bounds will be replaced. Geometry filters are handled separately from the filters specified in --replacement-filters since Hootenanny 
executes a different replacement changeset generation workflow dependent upon the geometry type of the feature being replaced. 

==== Replacement Filtering

The command option, --replacement-filters, allows for feature filtering beyond geometry type. One or more criterion class names can added to 
--replacement-filters for filtering beyond what is specified in --geometry-filters to determine the features that are used for replacement from 
the secondary dataset. The criteria specified may not be geometry type element criteria. From the command line, combine multiple criteria with 
a semicolon and surround the entire value string with quotes. 

The behavior of the filters is further configurable by the --chain-replacement-filters option. If --chain-replacement-filters is used, then a 
feature must pass all criteria in order to pass the filter specified in --replacement-filters.

Configuration options may be passed separately to the replacement filters via the --replacement-filter-options parameter. The option takes the 
form "<option name 1>=<option value 1>;<option name 2>=<option value 2>...". Do not prepend these options with "-D" as is normally done with 
configuration options passed in from the command line. Any identically named configuration options passed into the command prepended by "-D" 
may override these filtering configuration options.

=== Versioning

If the target of the resulting changeset is an OSM API database, all input features from the reference dataset must be populated with the 
correct changeset versions or application of the resulting changeset will fail. 

For Overpass API queries, add "out meta" to the query retrieving the reference data.

=== Unsupported Formats

GeoJSON output from the Overpass API is not supported by this command, since it does not contain way nodes.

=== Notes

As part of "this issue":https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny/issues/3429 , we'll look into providing the option to replace all reference
data within the specified bounds rather than just the reference data that overlaps secondary data.
