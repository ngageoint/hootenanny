== big-convert

=== Description

The +big-convert+ command uses a mapreduce cluster to convert from one input format to another.  
This does not perform any translation, only conversion.  Use this command instead of
+convert+ when working with very large amounts of data.  

=== Usage

--------------------------------------
big-convert (input) (output)
--------------------------------------

=== Supported Formats

The supported input formats are:

* OpenStreetMap Protocol Buffers (.osm.pbf)

The supported output formats are:

* OpenStreetMap API Database SQL file (.sql)
* OpenStreetMap API Database (osmapidb://)

=== Notes

==== Converting to SQL File or OSM API Database

* The input must be a .pbf file and it must reside on HDFS.
* The output should only be written to an offline database (no other writers).  The writer will disable the database
constraints before writing and re-enable them when writing is completed.
* All elements in the output belong to a single changeset.
* No OSM validation is done on the output.
