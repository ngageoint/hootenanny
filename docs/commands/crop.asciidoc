[[crop]]
== crop

=== Description

The +crop+ command crops a map to the given bounds. 

The default cropping behavior is that individual features on the border are modified to make sure nothing is outside the given bounds. This
behavior may be customized with the `crop.*` configuration options.

* +input+          - The input data path; may be any supported input format (e.g. OSM file).
* +output+         - The output data path; may be any supported output format (e.g. OSM file).
* +bounds+         - Comma delimited bounds. minx,miny,maxx,maxy e.g.38,-105,39,-104
* +--write-bounds+ - Optionally outputs a file containing the input bounds. The location of the file is controlled via the 
                     `bounds.output.file` configuration option.

=== Usage

--------------------------------------
crop (input.osm) (output.osm) (bounds) [--write-bounds]
--------------------------------------

=== Configuration Options

The configuration options `crop.*` control the behavior of map cropping. See their descriptions for more detail.

==== Examples

--------------------------------------
# regular crop
hoot crop data/dc-roads/dcgis-cropped.osm "-77.0551,38.8845,-77.0281,38.9031"

# don't split feature that cross the bounds
hoot crop -D crop.keep.entire.features.crossing.bounds=true data/dc-roads/dcgis-cropped.osm "-77.0551,38.8845,-77.0281,38.9031"

# only keep features completely within the bounds
hoot crop -D crop.keep.only.features.inside.bounds=true data/dc-roads/dcgis-cropped.osm "-77.0551,38.8845,-77.0281,38.9031"

# reverse the crop; keep only features outside of the bounds
hoot crop -D crop.invert=true data/dc-roads/dcgis-cropped.osm "-77.0551,38.8845,-77.0281,38.9031"
