=== Description

The +crop+ command crops a map to the given bounds. The default cropping behavior is that individual features on the border 
are modified to make sure nothing is outside the given bounds. This behavior may be customized with the `crop.*` 
configuration options.

* +output+         - The output data path; may be any supported output format (e.g. OSM file).
* +bounds+         - Comma delimited bounds. minx,miny,maxx,maxy e.g.38,-105,39,-104
* +--write-bounds+ - Optionally outputs a file containing the input bounds. The location of the file is controlled via the 
                     `bounds.output.file` configuration option.
