[[de-duplicate]]
== de-duplicate

=== Description

The +de-duplicate+ command removes intra-map duplicate elements from a single map or inter-map duplicate elements across 
two separate maps. For inter-map de-duplication, the first map's features are kept. Unlike cleaning operations, such as `DuplicateWayRemover`, this command will only remove completely identical elements and not just those that are very similar.

* +input1+                 - First map with features to de-duplicate; may be any supported input format. If only one map input 
                             is specified, only intra-map de-duplication is performed. When two input maps are specified 
                             and identical features are found between both maps, this map's features are retained.
* +input2+                 - Optional second map with features to de-duplicate; may be any supported input format. When two 
                             input maps are specified, both intra-map and inter-map de-duplicate is performed. When two 
                             input maps are specified and identical features are found between both maps, this map's features 
                             are removed.
* +output1+                - The de-duplicated first map output; may be any supported output format.
* +output2+                - The de-duplicated second map output; may be any supported output format; required if two inputs 
                             are specified.
* +--favor-connected-ways+ - When two identical ways are found, favors the way with more connections with other ways, 
                             regardless of which input map its from.
