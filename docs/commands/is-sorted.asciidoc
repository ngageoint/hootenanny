[[is-sorted]]
== is-sorted

=== Description

The `is-sorted` command determines whether data has been sorted by element type and ID.

This operation is fast for OSM PBF file, since their headers can simply be checked to see if the file is sorted. For all 
other formats, the data is read in one feature at a time and a negative result is returned as soon as an unsorted element 
is found. If the data is sorted, the entire contents of the input will be read before a positive verification.

* `input` - Input; may be any supported input format (e.g. .osm file).
