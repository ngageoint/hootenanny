[[cookie-cut]]
== cookie-cut

=== Description

When you have two data sets to conflate where one is clearly better than the other in every way (attributes and geometric accuracy), 
the cookie cutter can be a very useful tool. For instance, you may have country wide primary roads and very high quality city 
scale roads for a small region. In this case you'll want to remove a section of the country scale roads, then conflate the 
high quality roads back in.  The +cookie-cut+ command functions by reading in a OSM input file as the +cutter-shape+ and 
removes the cookie cutter shape from the contents of the 'dough' file. The resulting geometries are written to 'output'. 
The dough input is limited by the available RAM.

* +cutter-shape+ - The input Polygons to use as the cutter shape.
* +dough+        - The input OSM data to cut from.
* +output+       - The output OSM data path.
* +buffer+       - Optional buffer value, if the buffer value is provided then the
                   shape is buffered by this many meters before cutting. The buffer may be
                   positive or negative.
* +--crop+       - Optional crops based on the polygon rather than doing a cookie cut.

=== Usage

--------------------------------------
cookie-cut (cutter-shape) (dough) (output) [buffer] [--crop]

==== Example

--------------------------------------
wget http://dcatlas.dcgis.dc.gov/catalog/download.asp?downloadID=88&downloadTYPE=ESRI
hoot convert -D schema.translation.script=DcRoads StreetSegmentLn.shp DcBig.osm
cp $HOOT_HOME/test-files/DcTigerRoads.osm DcSmall.osm
# It is a good idea to manually verify the alpha shape for correctness after it
# is generated. -15m works well for this square data, but will likely cause
# issues on more complex shapes.
hoot generate-alpha-shape DcSmall.osm 1000 -15 DcSmallBounds.shp
hoot cookie-cut DcSmallBounds.shp DcBig.osm DcBigCut.osm
hoot conflate DcSmall.osm DcBigCut.osm ConflatedDc.osm
