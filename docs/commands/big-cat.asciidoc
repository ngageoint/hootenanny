== big-cat

=== Description

The +big-cat+ command reads data from the user specified inputs, renumbers the elements to avoid conflict and writes the result to 
+output.osm.pbf+.  This command does not require Hadoop.

* +output.osm.pbf+ - Output file name.
* +inputs+         - One or more .osm.pbf inputs.

The command does two passes over the input data. The first pass it to determine the range of element IDs and the second 
pass is used to write out the new results. No attempt is made to conflate the data files so it is primarily useful when putting 
together two files that are in very different regions.
