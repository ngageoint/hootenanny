== Command Line Documentation

All Hootenanny operations are available via the command line interface. The
following sections describe these operations in detail.

The base command line interface follows the following syntax:

-----
hoot (operation) [args...]
-----

Where +operation+ is an operation name such as +convert+ or +conflate+. The
parenthesis around +operation+ show that the argument is required.

+[args...]+ shows that there are zero or more arguments to the operation. The
brackets around +args...+ show that it is optional. This standard will be used
in the documentation when referring to each 

If at any time you need simple command line help just run +hoot+ without any
arguments and a short help screen will be displayed.
