== Command Line Documentation

All Hootenanny operations are available via the command line interface. The
following sections describe these operations in detail.

The base command line interface follows the following syntax:

-----
hoot (operation) [args...]
-----

Where +operation+ is an operation name such as +ogr2osm+ or +conflate+. The
parenthesis around +operation+ show that the argument is required.

+[args...]+ shows that there are zero or more arguments to the operation. The
brackets around +args...+ show that it is optional. This standard will be used
in the documentation when referring to each 

If at any time you need simple command line help just run +hoot+ without any
arguments and a short help screen will be displayed.

Commands that start with +big+ are commands for running against large data sets.
In general these commands will take longer on small data sets, or come with some
other caveat. If you aren't running into memory errors these should generally be
avoided.
