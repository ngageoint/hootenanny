== optimize-conflate-settings

=== Description

Runs a series of conflation tests to determine the best performing values for a user specified group 
of configuration options.

* +testsDir+ - the root directory containing the tests to run; the directory must contain Hootenanny conflate case tests, release regression tests, or PERTY regression tests
* +testType+ - the type of test to run; valid values are 'case', 'release', or 'perty'
* +testSettings+ - a JSON file containing configuration with min/max test values; see 'test-files/cmd/slow/OptimizeConflateSettingsCmd/testSettings.json' for an example
* +numIterations+ - the number of test iterations to run
* +output+ - file location to write the text summary of the optimization to
* +verbose+ - if true; logs extra detail during the optimization run
* +customConfig+ - file location of a custom Hootenanny configuration file containing 
static configuration options to apply to the tests (configuration values remain constant for the 
duration of the test run (optional)

=== Usage

--------------------------------------
optimize-conflate-settings (testsDir) (testType) (testSettings) (numIterations) (output) [customConfig]
--------------------------------------

==== Example

--------------------------------------
hoot optimize-conflate-settings test-files/cases/hoot-rnd/network/conflicts case settings.json 50 output Config.conf
--------------------------------------

NOTE: To use tests of type 'release' or 'perty' you must have access to the Hootenanny regression tests, which are
not supplied with Hootenanny by default.  Also, currently only the Network Conflation versions of those tests
will work with this settings optimizer.
