[[generate-alpha-shape]]
== generate-alpha-shape

=== Description

The +generate-alpha-shape+ command provides a way to generate a "concave hull" for a set of points.  Specifically, it reads data from 
one input, calculates the alpha shape and writes the resulting multipolygon to output. This is most useful when seeding the 
+cookie-cut+ command.  The degree of the concaveness is determined by the alpha parameters. A small alpha parameter creates a 
shape with a large number of holes and concave sections. A large alpha value creates a shape closer to a convex hull. An alpha 
value equal to the maximum distance between any two points in the data or larger will create a convex hull. Additional details 
can be found in the _Cookie Cutter_ section of <<hootalgo, Hootenanny - Algorithms>>.

There is a brief PowerPoint available on the subject
https://insightcloud.digitalglobe.com/redmine/attachments/download/1144/Hootenanny%20-%20Alpha%20Shape%202013-03-07.pptx[here].

* +points+ - The input data to use for deriving the alpha shape. The alpha shape
             algorithm is used to derive a polygon representing the bounds. The inputs may
             be a +.osm.pbf+, +.osm+ or +.shp+ file
* +alpha+  - The size in meters used for alpha. A larger value makes a smoother
             shape and a smaller value will create a rough shape with more holes. Value in
             meters.
* +buffer+ - The buffer to add to the alpha shape before cutting. A negative
             value will make the shape smaller. Value in meters. Generally a buffer of zero
             will be used. If using the alpha shape command with cookie cutter it is a good
             idea to use a larger negative value on complex data shapes. This will limit
             the number of holes in the data. A negative value equal to the alpha value is
             a good rule of thumb.
* +output+ - The output +.osm.pbf+ or +.shp+ data path.

When output to a +.osm+ file the alpha shape will always be a multi-polygon with
one attribute +area=yes+. When output as a Shapefile it will be a multipolygon
shapefile with a single record. Hootenanny doesn't support relations in
+.osm.pbf+ files.
