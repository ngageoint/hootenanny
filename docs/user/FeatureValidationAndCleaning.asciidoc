== Feature Validation

Hootenanny allows for tagging features which fail https://josm.openstreetmap.de/[JOSM] validation 
tests or its own validation checks without attempting to fix the validation errors. Map elements 
will be tagged with 'hoot:validation:error' which describes the error and 
'hoot:validation:error:source' which shows the validator that found the error.

=== Hootenanny Validator Detail

Hootenanny primarily relies on https://josm.openstreetmap.de/[JOSM] for validation, as most of its
cleaning routines do not double as validators (some could be made to, though, if needed). The 
validators Hootenanny does have are documented here.

==== Crossing Roads

Hootenanny will attempt to detect roads that incorrectly cross polygons automatically after 
conflation (this is not part of the `validate` command). This is primarily helpful when a newer 
dataset is conflated with an older one where you want to keep provenance in the older data while 
bringing in as many of the features from the new dataset as possible. A rules file, specified by the `highway.crossing.poly.rules` configuration option, controls which polygons are search for roads 
over them and which roads are allowed to cross certain polygons (if any). For example, there are any 
instances where we would want to see a road crossing though a building but we allow a service road 
to pass through a parking lot. The rules file will require maintenance over time as more road 
crossing data scenarios are encountered.

File format example:

+
-----
{
  "rules":
  [
    {
      "name": "buildings",
      "polyCriteriaFilter": "BuildingCriterion"
    },
    {
      "name": "parking",
      "polyTagFilter": "amenity=parking",
      "allowedRoadTagFilter": "highway=service;highway=footway"
    }
  ]
}
-----

"name" is the name of the rule; required and used for readability purposes in reviews

"polyCriteriaFilter" consists of one or more Hootenanny element criterion class names that are 
logically OR'd together to create a type filter for the polygons which are search for roads crossing 
over them. The form of the value string is: <criterion 1>;<criterion 2>...; 
e.g. BuildingCriterion;AreaCriterion"

"polyTagFilter" consists of one or more tag key/value pairs that are logically OR'd together to 
create a tag filter used to determine which types of polygons are checked for crossing roads using 
tag checks of the form: <key1=value1>;<key2=value2>...; e.g. "amenity=parking;leisure=park"

At least one of "polyCriteriaFilter" and "polyTagFilter" must be specified. Both may be specified 
but it is not required.

"allowedRoadTagFilter" determines which type of roads are allowed to cross the polygons being search 
for in this rule. It consists one or more highway tag key/value pairs that are logically OR'd 
together to create a tag filter used to determine which types of polygons are checked for crossing 
roads using tag checks of the form: <key1=value1>;<key2=value2>...; e.g. 
"highway=service;highway=footway"

[[FeatureCleaning]]
== Feature Cleaning

Hootenanny allows for cleaning features which fail JOSM validation tests and/or those that 
Hootenanny internally identifies as requiring cleaning. Both Hootenanny cleaning operations and JOSM 
auto-fix capabilities may be used for cleaning.
