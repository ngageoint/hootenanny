==== Background

Hootenanny deploys with an interactive web-based user interface adapted from the MapBox iD Editor. This offers several benefits including its open license that allows users to customize and add functionality, along with an in-depth editing capability that was originally designed for interactive editing of OSM features. Hootenanny is designed to facilitate automated and semi-automated conflation of critical Foundation GEOINT features in the topographic domain, namely roads (polylines), buildings (polygons), and points-of-interest (POIs) (points). Conflation happens at the dataset level, where the user’s workflow determines the best reference dataset and source content, geometry and attributes, to transfer to the output map. The input data must be normalized to allow processing and matching of features and attributes from different schemas. Hootenanny internal processing leverages the key value pair structure of OpenStreetMap (OSM) for improved utility and applicability to broader user groups, e.g. normalized attributes can be used to aid in feature matching and OSM’s free tagging system allows the map to include an unlimited number of attributes describing each feature. Depending on the data and selected conflation options, the process of resolving ambiguous features is handled by an interactive conflict resolution workflow. Hootenanny cues up conflicts and drives the user to each conflict to make the appropriate geometry or attribute fix. Additionally, the user has the option to edit other features they may come across that need correcting while working through the conflict cue. For users that do not want to perform this manual editing or want to accept the automated solution in full, there is the option to accept all or discard all conflicts. This becomes a user choice and ultimately a risk assessment between accepting geometry and attribute errors resulting from automated algorithms versus the use purpose of the end product.

The general case of the Hootenanny conflation workflow is shown in <<HootConflationWorkflow2>> and depicts the high-level steps necessary to conflate data and generate an output map in Hootenanny. It is important for the user to understand these functions as each have implications on the conflated results. The squares represent a specific conflation task, while the oval canisters represent a database function. The workflow is described as follows:

[[HootConflationWorkflow2]]
.Hootenanny Conflation Workflow.
image::images/id/hoot_general_workflow.png[]

Hootenanny currently supports the conflation of POIs, Building polygons, Transportation polylines (highways, cart tracks, trails, bridges, and tunnels), and experimentally, Waterway polylines (hydrologic features such as rivers, streams, drainage, and ditches).   When conflating these features, it is important to note that conflation occurs between similar feature types (e.g. POI to POI, Building to Building, Transportation polyline to Transportation polyline, etc.) but not across feature domains (POI to Polygon, POI to Polyline, etc.).

This guide is intended as a general purpose reference to understand various components of the software functionality and provide simple use cases that demonstrate how to leverage these capabilities using publicly available datasets. The document is broken down into sections by application functionality such as adding new layers, editing map data, translation between different application schemas and performing conflation using reference and non-reference datasets. For background on the project history, command line interface, javascript api, and other technical details please refer to the Hootenanny User Guide.

==== Accessing Hootenanny

Hootenanny can be accessed from a web browser using the standard URL http://<your_servername):port/hootenanny-id/. The current version of Hootenanny iD is supported in Chrome (recommended), Chromium, and Firefox.

_Note: Some screenshots may not reflect the latest version of Hootenanny UI._

IMPORTANT: Drop-down menus in iD Editor can also act as a filter on the data.  If something is typed into the input box, the drop down will only show the user matching values if clicking in the input box.  If the user clicks on the down arrow, all options will be shown.

==== Adding Layers to the Map

During conflation, source datasets are merged based on user-specified conflation parameters to create an output layer that is ultimately superior in terms of complete geometry and attribution. Two datasets are required to perform a conflation; _Reference_ and _Secondary_ Data. To add a new Reference Dataset to the map, click on the _Add Reference Dataset_ button on the left side. A list of available layers will appear in the drop down menu as shown in <<hoot_add_datasets>>. Note that in order to add a layer it must be <<Hoot-iD_Datasets,imported>> into Hootenanny using the workflow described in <<Hoot-iD_Datasets>>. Layers can also be added directly from the Dataset tab in Manage.  This is described in <<HootAddDataFromManage>>.

[[hoot_add_datasets]]
.Adding Datasets.  Click on Add Reference/Secondary Dataset button to display a list of available layers and folders.  Clicking on the folder icon e.g. dc, expands the contents showing all layers and subfolders.  In order to add a layer to the map it must be selected (highlighted in yellow).  To modify the layer color click on the palette or select OSM symbology then add to map. Recently used layers can be added using the dropdown menu shown. The size of the panel can be expanded to increase/decrease the width of the panel by dragging the sidebar (L in <<HootiD-UILayout>>) to the desired size.

[[HootiD-EditingLayers]]
==== Editing Features in Hootenanny

Similar to editing data in link:$$http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Editing$$[OpenStreetMap.org], users can select any point, line or polygon feature and modify both the geometry and attribution displayed. To aid the user during the editing process, Hootenanny provides the additional functionality of allowing users to toggle between different display tag schemas (OSM, TDS 6.1/4.0, and MGCP) by changing the Filter By Type drop down to the desired tag format.  This does _not_ modify the underlying data but merely changes the displayed tag schema in the left panel.

[[Filter-by-Type]]

image::images/id/hoot_filterbytype.png[scaledwidth="75%"]

===== Modifying Layer Attributes

When a feature has been selected (or a new one has been added), it is possible to modify both its <<ModifyLayerGeometry,geometry>> (e.g. moving a point, adding vertices, modifying the shape of a polygon, etc..) and the associated attribute values. First it's important to note that each tag schema maintains it's own set of default presets. For example, clicking on the Secondary Road icon using the OSM schema displays a list of suggested presets based on the schema and element type (poi, line, area). If a type does not appear listed, type the name (e.g. Culvert) in the Search window that appears when you click on the icon. To learn more about a tag such as Secondary Road, click on the 'i' button next to the preset and an image will pop-up as shown below with a link to the OpenStreetMap Wiki page for that feature. Values for each field can be edited by clicking in each attribute and either typing or selecting from a set of pre-populated values. Note that both OSM and TDS schemas will only support a set of limited values for certain fields so it's best to consult domain subject matter experts when modifying.

[[ViewingPresets]]
.Click on the info 'i' to bring up more information about a preset.
image::images/id/hoot_preset_info.png[scaledwidth="25%"]

The _All Tags_ section shown below contains all of the feature tags for a layer that have been translated from their native data structure to Hootenanny during <<Hoot-iD_Datasets,import>>. If an expected tag does not appear, it might be a good time to revisit the translation steps described in <<TranslationAssistant>>, <<HootiD-Translation>> or review the original source data. New fields can be added by clicking on the Add Field drop down menu and selecting an appropriate value. Additional tags can be added by clicking on the '+' button at the bottom of the All tags shown below. To delete or display additional info about a tag, click on either the trash can or info icons that appear next to each tag. Note that any changes will not be final to a layer until the user clicks on Save to commit the edits to the Hootenanny database. For OSM tags, users can check the 'Sort A-Z' box to sort tags in alphabetical order.

.Displaying all OSM feature tags in Hootenanny. Note check boxes are shown for tags that a user might copy/paste into a matching feature.
image::images/id/hoot_alltags_OSM.png[scaledwidth="25%"]

NOTE: You can check all/none tags for a selected feature by clicking on the bold check that appears just above the "All Tags" table.

[[ModifyLayerGeometry]]
===== Modifying Layer Geometry

To modify the feature geometry, click on the feature to expose the editing palette that pertains to the particular selected feature. Note that each unique geometry type and shape present their own options that may not display for other features. For instance, selecting a linear feature exposes editing options to straighten or change the directionality whereas clicking on a feature that traces a square, rectangle or circular path exposes options to make the feature a square or circle. Editing options include adding additional nodes by double clicking on a line segment, moving a node to manually modify the shape or path of a line or polygon, moving a point, and deleting features. For a list of shortcut keys to each operation, see <<Hoot-iD_Shortcuts, short-cuts>>.

image::images/id/hoot_edit_geom.png[scaledwidth="50%"]

In order to save any edits applied to a layer click on the _Save_ button displayed on top in the map view or to revert to a previous edit. Save will commit any edits on a particular layer to the hoot database where as the Undo/Redo buttons will step back/forward through any modifications applied to either that layer’s geometry or attribution. The number displayed next to the Save button indicates the number of edits that will be committed to the database for a given session.

.Saving edits in Hootenanny. The user applied the editing option to square the corners of line feature to expose the Save button above. The number of edits made before committing (2 in this example) is displayed in addition to options for undo/redo changes. Port Au Prince, Haiti; OSM Highway data (pink); DigitalGlobe GlobalBasemap (GBM).
image::images/id/hoot_edit_save.png[scaledwidth="75%"]

==== Adding New Features

It is also possible to create new features for a given layer in Hootenanny iD but any new feature added must be done with at least one layer present. Note that any new features added without an associated layer cannot be saved. The ability to create new features within the GUI is a key component of the OpenStreetMap version of iD Editor and additional background and editing workflows can be found online via link:$$https://www.openstreetmap.org/edit?editor=id$$[OpenStreetMap-iD's] help menu. A brief background is provided here for general user orientation.

To add a new point, click on the Point button appearing in the Map Viewer or use the 1 shortcut key. Points can be used to represent features such as shops, restaurants, parks and monuments, etc. They mark a specific location and describe the feature based on the OSM/TDS tag relationship. Once a new point is added to the map, a panel will appear on the map prompting you to select an appropriate feature type (park, cafe, etc) and any associated tags. Note that even though OSM values are presented, the data is stored on the database using the TDS tag equivalent. The next time it is edited within Hootenanny it will display the values using the english translated TDS schema.

.Adding a new point in Hootenanny. In this example a new Point is added to the Haiti OSM roads data indicating that the feature represents a Hospital Grounds `amenity=hospital`. DigitalGlobe GlobalBasemap (GBM).
image::images/id/hoot_adddata.png[scaledwidth="75%"]

To add a new linear feature, click on the Line button or use the 2 shortcut key and begin digitizing on the map. Click on a single location to begin the linear feature and then continue clicking until feature has been completed. Double-click to complete the process and edit any attribution as needed. Repeat process for a new Area feature (shortcut = 3). Click Save to save all edits or step back/forward using the undo/redo buttons as needed.

NOTE: Line snapping is disabled by default. To enable it click on the <<MapData, Map Data>> button and check the enable line snap option.

===== Copying Features/Tags in Hootenanny

In certain circumstances it may be useful to utilize copy/paste functionality when editing layers and addressing conflict reviews within Hootenanny.  For example, if users need to create multiple copies of a selected feature (or set of features) within the same map layer (e.g. foot path, bridge, secondary road, POI, etc...) or they would like to copy tags from one feature to another similar feature, the following workflows can be used.

NOTE: Currently users can only copy/paste geometry and tags of any feature(s) within a single "active" layer or copy selected tags from a feature(s) and either overwrite or merge them with the tags from selected feature(s) in either layer.  It is currently _not_ possible to copy/paste a feature from the Reference Dataset to the Secondary Dataset (or vice-versa) manually and if attempted the application will enter a idle state requiring refresh.

*_Copying Features/Tags Within a Single Layer_*

To copy a feature(s) within a single layer, select the feature or set of features that you wish to copy using the left-mouse button (for multiple features press the _shift_ key during selection).  Use the `Ctrl + c` to copy the selected feature(s) and then `Ctrl + v` to display a duplicate feature(s) that can be placed anywhere on the map.

.Copying Feature Geometry/Tags within a Layer.  The selected item, a Monument named Major General Rochambeau is copied and pasted.  Note that the `name` tag is not copied to the newly created feature since it is assumed to be unique.
image::images/id/hoot_copy_feature.png[scaledwidth="75%"]

NOTE: If only specific tags are needed to manually copy from one feature to another within a single layer do not use Ctrl + c but instead check the box next to each tag in the 'All Tags' list and follow the steps described <<CopyTagsFeatures,below>>.

*_Copying Tags Between Features_*

When <<HootConflictReview,reviewing>> conflicts or editing features it is often useful to be able to copy tags from a selected feature and either append or overwrite the tags of another feature that can be within the same layer or in a different layer.  For example, when conflating two layers a selected set of features are flagged for the user to review and determine whether any further action is required. This is explained using the following POI scenario involving OSM and MGCP place name features in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2°58'40.82" N 22°20'45.08" E).

[[CopyTagsFeatures]]
1) Select a source point (orange highlighted marker) and check the boxes next to each tag in the All Tags list that you wish to copy to the other feature.

.List of tags from source feature with selected tags checked.  Data sources are OSM (pink) and MGCP (orange) POI data in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (2°58'40.82" N 22°20'45.08" E). DigitalGlobe GlobalBasemap (GBM).
image::images/id/hoot_copysourcetags.png[scaledwidth="50%"]

2) Select a target point (pink highlighted marker) and expand the All Tags list to display the existing tags. Note that the name in this selected OSM POI is "Badjoki" whereas in the MGCP feature it is "Bodjoki".

image::images/id/hoot_selecttargetPOI.png[scaledwidth="50%"]

3) To append the copied tags, select the OSM POI (pink highlighted marker) and hit `Ctrl + Alt + v`.  Note that this action will produce a semicolon delimited list for any existing value e.g. name, source along with any new tags added from the source POI e.g. `landuse = built_up_area`; `place:importance=fifth`; `place=village`, etc.  To commit changes click the Save button or to undo click the undo button.

==== Hootenanny Map Tools

The Hootenanny map portion of the interface mirrors the OpenStreetMap iD editor link:$$https://www.openstreetmap.org/edit?editor=id$$[OpenStreetMap-iD] with additional customization to support conflation workflows. Map navigation options appear in the upper right portion of the map viewer noted by B in figure <<HootiD-UILayout>>. To view a maptip and/or <<Hoot-iD_Shortcuts,shortcut>>, hover the cursor over each button and information concerning the functionality of a particular feature will appear.

===== Map Navigation

Clicking on either '+' or '-' buttons will zoom the user one level higher/lower in the map. Alternatively users can use the middle scroll wheel of their mouse to zoom up or down levels. To open the map to your current location, click on the arrow button noting that some browser security settings do not allow users to share their location information.

===== Background Settings

Clicking on the Background Settings button (shortcut key = b) opens up a panel displaying different background layer display options. To set the brightness for the background layer, click on the palette next to Background for 100%, 75%, 50%, or 25% brightness. Users can select from a range of publicly available basemaps such as Bing aerial imagery, MapQuest Open Aerial, Mapbox Satellite, OpenStreetMap, or create a custom basemap URL using the following URL template shown below. Any user uploaded <<Hoot-iD_Basemap,Basemap>> images will appear in this panel. For those users with access to DigitalGlobe link:$$https://evwhs.digitalglobe.com/myDigitalGlobe/[EV Web Hosting Service] (EVWHS), the GBM/EGD imagery service can be selected using different imagery profiles e.g. Most Recent, Most Aesthetic Color, Least Cloud Cover.

NOTE: The DigitalGlobe EVWHS basemap is not enabled by default due to user access restrictions. If an account has been set up with a valid Connect ID, you will need to edit the _dgservices.js_ file to set `evwhs_connectId = 'REPLACE_ME'` and rebuild the UI with `npm run production`.

===== Image Carousel

The image carousel displays all of the available images by timestamp and sensor that are in the DigitalGlobe GBM/EGD service if the service has been enabled. Users can select a particular DigitalGlobe image from the listed sensors/dates displayed in the carousel by clicking on the Image Carousel button (highlighted in blue below) or typing the 'c' shortcut key.

NOTE: The image carousel thumbnails do not appear, only the image acquisition date and sensor type (e.g. WV02, WV01, WV03_VNIR, etc...).

[[MapData]]
===== Map Data

The Map Data options, which can be accessed by clicking on the map data button located above the help menu (shortcut key = F), allow users to incorporate different overlay layers like the mapillary and traffic sign photos, change the default map fill and line width values, and provides a filtering capability for different map feature types (e.g. Points, Roads, Buildings, etc.).

.Map Data options.
image::images/id/hoot_mapdata.png[scaledwidth="25%"]

*_Data Layers_*

Within the Data Layers menu, users can overlay link:$$https://www.mapillary.com$$[mapillary] traffic sign and street view photos. Mapillary is a service for crowdsourcing street level photos using smartphones and computer vision.  Checking the boxes displays icons representing locations for crowdsourced street level photos and traffic signals.  When a user clicks on each icon, a photo will appear in the lower left or right corner of the map providing the visual representation from vantage point represented.

.Mapillary traffic sign and street view photos displayed in Hootenanny/iD Editor.
image::images/id/hoot_mapillary.png[]

It is also possible to overlay a local GPX file (GPS generated dataset) using the file browser to add the dataset into the map.  Although these features found in Data Layers are not the primary tools used when conflating data, they can utilized since they are inherited from the base iD Editor version that Hootenanny has been developed from.

*_Fill Areas and Line Width_*

Fill Areas allows users to select from three different options for displaying relevant vector data. The first option is _No Fill_ or Wireframe (shortcut key = W) which makes it easier to display background imagery. _Partial Fill_ displays fill areas around their inner edges only. _Full Fill_ displays features with complete fill turned. To make the lines from map layers appear thicker/thinner, users can unchecking the _Use Default Value_ appearing under the Line Width option and nudge the width value up/down accordingly.

*_Map Features_*

To filter out different features of interest, simply check or uncheck the boxes next to each associated map feature e.g. Points, Major Roads, Buildings, etc.  Note that this will not impact conflation since this only impacts the display of features on the map, not the actual data contained within a given layer.  We have also provided some additional enhancements to aid in the editing of feature geometry by adding two additional options; Highlight Edited Layer and Enable Line Snap.  Highlight Edited Layer turns on a gold halo around any feature geometry that is actively being edited on the map.  Once the Save button is clicked, the highlighting will dissappear as it is only intended to show active edits, not saved changes to a layer.  Finally the enable line snap option is provided to set the default behavior when adding new line/area geometry onto the map.  When enable line snap is checked, this feature is enabled and any new line segment that is added close to an existing feature geometry will be snapped to that feature.

===== Tools

The Tools button provides users with a quick set of customized tools for measuring length/area and cropping layers to smaller subsets using either the visual extent or user defined bounding box. To access both options click on the _Tools_ button and select either Measurement or Clip Tools.

[[Hoot_Tools]]
.Tools button shown in Hoot UI.
image::images/id/hoot_tools.png[scaledwidth="75%"]

[[Hoot_measure]]
*_Measurement Tools_*

There are two measurement tools currently provided; Measure linear distance or length of an object and measure the area of an object. To measure the length of an object on the map, click on the Tools button and select Measurement Tools | Measure Length.  The cursor will then change into crosshairs indicating that you are able to measure a feature by drawing a line.  To continue a drawing, left click to add nodes as needed.  To complete the measurement double-click. To measure an area/perimeter of a feature, select the Measure Area option and click on the screen to add nodes and double click to complete the measurement.  The measurement values will appear with the perimeter value listed above the area.  This value will remain on the map until the user clicks the Clear button appearing in the place of Tools once a new measurement has been added.  Users can zoom and pan on the map while capturing a measurement.

image::images/id/hoot_measure_area.png[scaledwidth="75%"]

*_Clip Tools_*

The _Clip Dataset_ tool allows users to crop existing datasets using a custom bounding box or the current visual extent of the map.  To access this tool click on the Tools | Clip Tools | Clip Dataset button which will open a dialog box that supports three mechanisms to define a clip bounding box.  First the bounding box can be defined by manually entering coordinate values in the displayed box.  Secondly, the user can click on _Clip to Bounding Box_ and drag a box over a specific AOI to populate the clip region bounding box coordinates.  Third, users can select _User Visual Extent_  and pass in the current map visual extent as the clip region.  To define a bounding box on the map, single left-click on any location on the map within the source dataset AOI and drag window to the desired clip size and direction.

Once a bounding box (or visual extent) has been selected, additional options to specify an output name and path of the clipped dataset will appear.  After the job has completed it will show up in the list of available datasets and specified output folder.

image::images/id/GrailTools.png[scaledwidth="75%"]

*Grail pull from OSM Overpass and the Rails Port*

Under the tools section in the Hootenanny UI there will be a section labeled "Grail Tools". Under that
you should see the option to "Pull Remote Data". Once selected you will be prompted to select a bounding
box region by either drawing the bounding box or using the visual extent as your bounding box. Once selected
you can submit the job for running. After the job has completed you should see a folder with the name of
grail_*coordinates for your bounding box* which should contain a filed named "reference" (the Rails Port data)
and a file named "secondary" (the OSM Overpass data).
These datasets can be used to run conflation jobs, step through review in the merged layer, then derive a changeset
and upload it to the remote rails port.

[[Hoot_grailPull_Map]]
.Grail Pull directory contains pulled files in a directory labeled grail_*coordinate for bounding box*.
image::images/id/GrailPull.png[scaledwidth="75%"]

*Derive Differential Changeset*

Under the tools section in the Hootenanny UI there will be a section labeled "Grail Tools". Under that
you should see the option for "Derive Differential Changeset". This tool is used for gathering only the data
in OSM Overpass that isn't already in the Rails Port and pushing it to the Rails Port so it will only consist of adds. There will not
be any files generated that you can view in the UI because this service will take the OSM Overpass and the Rails Port data from
the database and calculate the differential on the server without saving the datasets. While the datasets will not
be saved, an osm file will be generated on the server.
In the jobs panel you can find the Derive Changeset job and under the actions there will be a cloud icon with an up arrow.
This is what you use to upload the differential results to the Rails Port, but before doing that you can view stats on the differential
upload. The stats will include the counts of create, modify, and delete for nodes, ways, and relations.
The differential will not contain any secondary features involved in a review.

====  Conflation Workflows

When conflating data in Hootenanny, users must have both a Reference Dataset and a Secondary Dataset loaded in the map. Once the layers have been selected, the _Conflate_ button will appear with various options that can be selected by the user.  The following section(s) highlight those options as well as explore different types of conflation strategies using publicly available datasets.  When users are ready to conflate they will need to populate the following fields.

[[HootiD-conflationoptions]]
.Conflation options displayed in lower left panel. In this example, a reference conflation between OSM roads (pink) and MGCP roads (orange) in Port Au Prince, Haiti is displayed on DigitalGlobe GlobalBasemap (GBM).
image::images/id/hoot_conflation_new.png[]

*_Save As_*:  The name you would like to save the merged layer as. By default, a file name Merged_* is populated in this field but this can be overwritten manually by entering a specific layer name.  If no value is provided a default name will be provided.

*_Path_*:  The existing folder path where you want to save the conflated output. To create a new folder to save the output enter that in the _New Folder Name_ field.

*_New Folder Name_* (optional): The name of any new folder you want to save the output to.  Note that it will be created at the folder level specified in the Path.  Leave blank if no new folder is required.

*_Type_*:  This is the type of conflation you want to run.  Note that there are four conflation options available: _Reference Conflation_, _Cookie Cutter & Horizontal Conflation_ and _Advanced Conflation_.

[[HootiD-AttributionRefLayer]]
*_Attribute Reference Layer_*:  By default, the Reference layer contains both the geometry and attribution that dictates the merged features. In many cases, however, reference geometry and attribution exists across multiple layers and therefore we provide the ability to utilize the Secondary layer as the reference attribution for cases where the secondary layer is determined to contain the most accurate tag information while the reference layer contains the most accurate geometry.

[[HootStats]]
*_Collect Stats?_*: True/False. Allows users to collect statistics about the performance of a conflation job such as the counts of pois, highways, buildings or the percentage of merged/reviewed features and display them underneath the layer as shown in <<Hootlayerstats>>. To enable this switch the drop-down from false to true.  To view the stats collected, click on the `i` next to the layer name and expand the Statistics as shown below.

[[Hootlayerstats]]

==== Conflation Info and Statistics

Hootenanny provides users with the ability to generate statistics and display information pertaining to each conflation and associated input layers. Statistics are collected when users set the collect stats option to _true_ for a given conflation as described <<HootStats,here>>.  If collect stats = false, Hootenanny will display only the conflation parameters i.e. the Reference/Secondary layer names and Conflation Type, and Options, i.e. what args were included in the conflation job, for the merged layer after the conflation job has completed. When the Collect Stats option is set to true, Hootenanny will generate statistics such as the counts for all nodes, ways and relations in each of the input and output layers (similarly for counts of pois, roads, and buildings), counts of unmatched, merged, and review features as well as percentages for each.  These formatted statistics are displayed in the _Statistics_ section of the layer info shown in <<Hootlayerstats>>.  In addition to these stats, users can also view the raw statistics that Hootenanny collects when this option has been enabled.  These values appear as comma separated lists (e.g. Total Conflatable Features = 374,227,0) pertaining to the Reference Layer, Secondary Layer, and Merged Output Layer next to each statistic parameter.

==== Types of Conflation

===== Reference Conflation

Reference conflation assumes that the Reference Dataset contains the most accurate geometry/tag info with the Secondary Dataset containing the non-authoritative features to merge.  By default, Hootenanny assumes that the Reference Dataset contains the reference tag values but users have the option to set this to the secondary dataset by selecting that layer in the Attribute Reference Layer dropdown list.

When using Reference Conflation the output is assumed to contain the following:

1) Matched feature geometry/tags from the Secondary Dataset into the Reference Dataset.

2) Unmatched feature geometry/tags from both the Reference and Secondary Datasets.

NOTE: If a required tag has a null or missing value, a default value will get assigned based on the output specification for that field and data type.

===== Cookie Cutter & Horizontal Conflation

Cookie Cutter & Horizontal Conflation is intended for use cases where a lower quality dataset such as a rural road network generated from a low resolution map needs to be conflated with a more accurate or precise dataset such as a urban centerline layer digitized from accurate high resolution imagery. In this scenario, the higher quality data (typically representing an urban area a city core) is buffered and cut, then stitched into the coarse resolution road layer using edge matching routines to create blend of the two layers. To walk through a sample Horizontal Conflation use case see <<HootiD-HorizontalConflationExample>>.  Additional background on Cookie Cutter and Horizontal conflation can also be found in the link:$$https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny/releases/download/v0.2.20/Hootenanny.-.User.Guide.pdf$$[Hootenanny User Guide]. When using this method the following settings are applied.

* The bounds of the Reference layer (cookie cut portion) are approximated using an alpha shape (e.g. cut command) that is created by generating a convex hull around the layer.
* The bounds of the Reference layer are buffered by 1km on each side of the convex hull (2 km distance in total). This improves the chances of merging seams between the two layers. Note that this operation works better at the city scale then at a regional or larger scale.
* The Secondary layer (dough portion) is cut by the alpha shape generated from the Reference layer and matched to road features within the Secondary layer that fall within the buffered retion.

[[HootiD-convexhull]]
.Example of alpha shape generated with a 1km buffer around a "contrived" urban area (not an actual physical location). The blue line represents the convex hull and the red the alpha shape with the applied -1 km buffer.
image::images/id/hoot_convexhull_example.png[scaledwidth="40%"]

NOTE: In the user interface there is no way to tune or modify the generated alpha shape. You can however configure the alpha-value from the command line (see alpha-shape in User Guide). In either case, the generated alpha shape will always approximate the bounds of the data regardless of shape of the urban area.

===== Advanced Conflation

Advanced Conflation allows users to customize a particular conflation job using a set of exposed advanced <<Advanced_Conflation_Options,options>>. These are intended for use cases where there is intimate familiarity with both the configuration parameters and the unique set of conditions that warrant their use. For example, to modify any of the Cleaning or Rubber Sheeting options when conflating rivers, users can simply expand the Cleaning Options and River Options panels and modify accordingly. Note that caution should be exercised when applying these as their use may produce unexpected results.

The advanced parameters are accessed by clicking on the triangle next the Type highlighted in the red box in <<HootiD-advanced>>. Background on each Advanced Conflation option can be found in <<Advanced_Conflation_Options>>.

[[HootiD-advanced]]
.Advanced Conflation Options. To access the Advanced Conflation Options click on triangle highlighted in the red box next to the Type.

[[HootiD-FavoriteAdvOpts]]
===== Save Favorite Advanced Options

To make it easier for users to save useful advanced conflation options, hootenanny allows for the saving, updating, and deleting of desired advanced conflation options.

To start, click the advanced options within the sidebar to extend the advanced options panel.

[[HootConflictReview]]
==== Reviewing Conflicts in Hootenanny

When conflating data it is inevitable that conflicts may arise due to the ambiguous relationships between matched features. When this occurs, reviewable items are flagged and presented to the user in the UI through an iterative review process where further user is required. This occurance of getting reviews during a conflation is often the result of any of the following circumstances:

* Invalid Input
* Conflicting matches – In the core conflict refers to two matches that cannot be applied to the same map.
* Records that somewhat match, but aren’t clearly a match or miss.

From the UI perspective, the term "Conflict" is used synonymously with "Review" but not all reviews are conflicts. Each type of data (POI, Buildings, Roads, etc.) when conflated introduce their own unique types of conflicts where the user is advised to take some action of either merging two POIs together, editing a layer geometry to eliminate any potential conflict or resolve the item as is to maintain as a separate feature.  No single solution can be provided to address a particular conflation conflict but rather it is up to the user to take the necessary steps based on the review text presented to reduce the likelihood that erroneous data will get introduced during the conflation process.

During review mode, the user is presented with a pair of features where they must take an appropriate action in order to resolve the review.  Depending on the features involved, a user can decide either to maintain these as separate features (as is) by clicking _Resolved_ (H), merge them into a single feature (POI 2 POI only) by clicking _Merge_ (E) then Resolved, or modify the feature geometry manually (see <<ModifyLayerGeometry>>).  Note with each review there is an accompaning review note (B) that provides a short detail on the reasons for reviewing the features in question but rarely does this provide enough information to take a specific action.  In depth knowledge of the datasets and coverage area by an appropriate data steward is typically required to provide the necessary guidance to take an action for a review.

[[ReviewMode_Layout]]
.Layout of Review Mode in Hootenanny: *A*: Overview with map-in-map results; *B*: Review note and counts; *C*: Share Review; *D*: Hide/Show Table; *E*: Merge feature (POI only); *F*: Preview Review; *G*: Next Review; *H*: Resolve Review; *I*: Review table (Red is Reference, Blue is Secondary); *J*: Attribute panel showing selected Reference POI tags; *K*: Highlighted Red/Blue reviewed POIs. Latvia POI data (OSM and geonames) displayed on DigitalGlobe GBM.
image::images/id/Hoot_reviewmode_layout.png[]

Clicking on any of the highlighted fields in the review table (I) selects the feature (either red/blue) in question and display its attribute in the left tag panel (item J in <<ReviewMode_Layout>>).  Users can toggle the review items table by clicking on the _Hide/Show Table_ button located in the conflict review bar at the bottom.  In order to complete the review process, all reviews must be resolved either by stepping through each individually or by clicking the _Complete Review_ button to resolve all remaining reviews.  After resolving reviews users can either export the data to the desired output format or add another layer for additional conflation.  Note that features displayed in green represent those which have been merged prior to the review and other colors represent the original input layers.

===== Review Text

When features are flagged as needing review, a number of different review notes may appear to provide some guidance to the user.  The review notes are general and don't provide the specific reasons why a pair of features are being reviewed against one another but do provide some context for understanding why a review may have occurred.  For example, the Review Note: The feature pair with a review score of 0.375 met the review threshold of 0.25 provides the review score and the threshold value which could be compared against other features with similar score and threshold values. Often when conflating POI data, review notes such as _Somewhat similar (200m) - very similar names and generic type, very close together, generic type to place match_ or _Somewhat similar (26m) - very close together, similar POI type_ will appear.  Those provide an indication of the reasons for being flagged and the distance between the POIs in the particular review.  Any specific questions regarding the reviews and required action can be created as a issue at www.github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny/issues.

[[ReviewRelations]]
===== Show Review Relations

When reviewing conflicts, a review is presented to the user with different options depending on the type of feature e.g. if POI they can merge or resolve, if building/road they can resolve, etc.  Reviews occur in a pairwise manner where feature a is reviewed against feature b but because any member of a review pair can also be involved in reviews against other features, it is important to provide a mechanism to display these relationships even if conflicts are only resolved between two features per review.  In an effort to account for these one to many relationships between reviewed features, users have the option to _show review relations_ for a given reviewed feature by clicking on the feature and then selecting the palette option, Show review relations for this feature (Shortcut: *Shift+R*). A line will appear from the feature to all related features with a letter designation depending on the order of the review inside a green circle.  In cases where there are more than 26 related reviews for a given feature, the letter displayed will appear as AA, BB, etc.  Each letter circles can be dragged around using a mouse cursor and clicking on it will open the review associated with that feature pair in the blue/red table.

[[ToggleInputs]]
===== Toggle Conflated Layer with Inputs

When evaluating the conflated output in review mode, it may be useful to toggle between the input dataset view where only the input layers are shown and the conflated dataset view where both input and merged features are displayed. For example if a user was trying to make a decision about whether to edit, resolve, or merge a set of reviewed/conflated features, they would likely need to know how the data looked prior to conflation.  To provide some additional context of the pre/post conflation results during review mode, click on the "Toggle Conflated Layer" icon (shortcut = T) as shown in <<ToggleLayerView>> when any feature has been selected. Note that you will need to toggle back to the merged layer view before advancing to the next review.

image::images/id/hoot_toggle.png[]

[[MapInMap]]
===== Map-in-Map

In Hootenanny, the concept of Map-in-Map is used here to describe an inset or overview map that contains additional spatial information relating to the conflation i.e where reviews occur within the AOI. When a conflation job completes and reviews are generated, users can display an overview map showing colored points representing the location (or centroid of the location) where unresolved, merged, and currently reviewed features occur for the corresponding AOI.  To view this map, press the `/` key when reviewing features and the smaller overview map should display a set of points representing the review layer.

Depending on the density of data flagged for review, the features are represented in the following manner: yellow dots corresponding to the location of unresolved reviews; a single red dot indicating the currently reviewed feature in the user's session; and green dots representing any resolved or merged features.  This visual aid becomes useful particularly when multiple users are editing the same layer simultaneously since it provides a map of the spatial distribution of reviews in real or near-real time.

In this example, a user is reviewing several POI review conflicts for a conflation between OpenStreetMap POIs and Geoname POIs within Riga, Latvia (Imagery is DigitalGlobe GBM Basemap).
image::images/id/hoot_mapinmap_review.png[scaledwidth="75%"]

===== Multi-user Conflict Reviewing

Hootenanny supports the ability for multiple users to view the same layer containing unresolved reviews.  Given the scenario of a reference conflation between two POI layers resulting in 15K reviews, any user with access to the same Hootenanny instance can load the merged layer containing the unresolved reviews and take any necessary action to resolve them.  To mitigate any toe-stepping that might occur due to multiple users accessing the same review pair simultaneously, reviews are presented in a randomized order such that there is a fairly low probability of two users getting the same review at the same time (assuming that the review count is high and the number of reviewers is low).  For those instances where a review is presented to two users simultaneously, the user that resolves their review first by clicking on the Resolved button will commit the change to the database.

[[HootShareReviews]]
===== Bookmark Review

When reviewing conflicts it is often useful to collaborate with others to determine the best coarse of action.  To this end, users can bookmark reviews so that they can be reviewed at a later time provided that the review is not resolved or the review layer is not deleted.  To bookmark a review, click on the associated button from the review items tool bar shown in <<HootBookmarkReview>>.

This will pop-up a dialog box allowing them to provide some details about the review.  A second user can access this bookmarked review from the Manage | Review Bookmarks page and take whatever action is needed.

[[HootBookmarkReview]]
.Bookmark Review.  Clicking the Bookmark Review button pops up a dialog box where a user can enter a title, description, note and email to associate with the review. The bookmark is then accessed in the Manage | Review Bookmarks page.

==== Conflating From An OSM API Database

IMPORTANT:  This section describes conflating data sourced from an OSM API database.  This feature is currently in the prototype phase and is
not recommended to be used with production OSM API databases where data loss/corruption would be a significant detriment to the
applications using the database.  At this time, it is recommended to only use this feature with OSM API test databases.  At which time this
feature is deemed stable enough to leave the prototype phase, this documentation will be updated.

Hootenanny uses a custom OSM database schema which differs from the public OSM API database schema used by OpenStreetMap, MapEdit, etc.  Hootenanny's OSM database schema differs in order to support its primary function, conflation, which has different needs than the
primary function of map editing supported by the public OSM database schema.

Hooteanny supports a conflation workflow where an OSM API database world dataset can be set as the conflation reference layer and any other
Hootenanny dataset can be conflated with that OSM API database data.  The resulting conflated dataset can then be exported out of Hootenanny and
back into the OSM API database.

A pre-requisite for conflating OSM API database data is that Hootenanny has been properly configured with a valid OSM API database connection.
Hootenanny supports only a single OSM API database connection at one time.  By default, Hootenanny is configured only with an empty test OSM
API database which has limited utility outside of application testing.  For details on how to configure Hootenanny to conflate your OSM API
database data, have you system administrator follow the instructions in the "Configuring OSM API Database Conflation" section of the
Hootenanny Installation Guide.  The documentation also describes how to disable OSM API database conflation completely, if that is desired.

After Hootenanny has been configured with an OSM API database connection, follow these steps to conflate data from an OSM API database:

* When an OSM API database is configured with Hootenanny, the first layer listed in the iD Editor layers list will always be named
`OSM_API_DB_<database-name>`.  Select this layer as the reference layer for your conflation job.  You will not see the data from the OSM API
database displayed on the iD Editor map due to a limitation described later in this section.
* Select any other layer stored within Hootenanny as the secondary layer for the conflation job.  You should first verify that your OSM
API database contains data within the AOI of your selected secondary dataset, or no data conflation will actually occur.
* Conflate the two layers.
* Resolve all review conflicts.

When you are ready to export your conflated layer back into your OSM API database:

* Open the Hootenanny dataset export dialog either immediately after conflation completes from the left hand pane or by opening it from the
`Manage` -> `Datasets` tab.
* Select `OSM API Database` as the export file type.  NOTE: The translation selection is ignored, since the output will be OSM data.
* Click the `Export` button.

Hootenanny will export an OSM changeset to the target OSM API database with the geospatial bounds of the original conflation
job that is the difference between the data originally exported from the OSM API database for conflation and the
resulting conflated data.

IMPORTANT: If any changeset with an overlapping geospatial bounds is written to the target OSM API database after the conflation job began which
created the conflated dataset stored in Hootenanny's database, Hootenanny will detect this conflict and not allow the changeset to be
written back into the OSM API database.

When such a conflict occurs, the only recourse is to execute the conflation job again.  Given this workflow, its best to find a "sweet spot"
between the size of the OSM API database AOI you are conflating and the editing activity within that AOI.  This will help to avoid conflicts.

IMPORTANT: Hooteannny writes all OSM API database OSM changesets from a single user account configured as described in the "Configuring OSM API
Database Conflation" section of the Hootenanny Installation Guide, since no user authentication exists in Hootenanny.  Therefore, data edited in
an OSM API database by Hootenanny will always show up as being edited by a single user.

Hootenanny only allows dataset layers which were the result of a conflation job originally run with OSM API database reference data to
be exported back into an OSM API database.  Datasets not meeting this qualification will be unavailable for export to an OSM API database when
using the iD Editor export feature.

There is no way to ingest data from an OSM API database into a Hootenanny data layer.  OSM API database can only be streamed
into Hootenanny during a conflation job.

There is also no way to directly view OSM data from an OSM API database within Hootenanny, since the two systems use different logic to display OSM
data.  Therefore, whenever an OSM API database layer is selected within iD Editor, Hootenanny will zoom to an arbitrary location and display no
OSM data.

There exists no mechanism in Hootenanny's iD Editor to upload data directly into an OSM API database from a file.  This can, however, be done
from the command line as explained in the "Hootenanny OSM API Database Conflation Testing Notes" section of the Hootenanny Developer's Guide.

For more detailed information on the workflow involved with conflating data sourced from an OSM
API database, see: link:$$https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny/wiki/Enhanced-Conflation-Workflow-Initial-Protoype--(aka-%22Holy-Grail%22)---ARCHIVE$$[Holy-Grail]

==== Conflation Examples

The following conflation examples are provided as guidance to help users better understand potential conflation and review issues that may arise keeping in mind that each scenario will vary tremendously from one to another depending on the characteristics of the source input data.

===== Reference Conflation: Washington DC GIS Roads against Census Tiger data.

The following workflow describes a simple use case conflating DC GIS Roads data against Tiger Census data derived from the source data below. In this example, the datasets DcGisRoads.osm and DcTigerRoads can be found in the `%HOOT_HOME/test-files/` directory where Hootenanny is installed (see <<Hoot-iD_Datasets,Data Ingest>>).

* Tiger Roads Source data: ftp://ftp2.census.gov/geo/tiger/TIGER2012/ROADS/tl_2012_11001_roads.zip
* DC GIS Roads Source data: http://dcatlas.dcgis.dc.gov/catalog/download.asp?downloadID=88&downloadTYPE=ESRI

Once the DcGisRoads and DcTigerRoads datasets have been ingested and loaded into the map as the Reference and Secondary Dataset respectively, click on the conflate button to expose the conflation options. Provide an output name, select type = Reference, leave the remaining options as default and click the _Conflate_ button.  Conflating these two layers will typically produce anywhere from 5-8 reviews.

.Hootenanny Reference conflation using DcGisRoads (blue) and DcTigerRoads (yellow) displayed on DigitalGlobe GBM.
image::images/id/hoot_reference_conflation.png[]

After the automatically merged features have completed, a number of reviewed features will be presented along with a corresponding review note and count e.g. Reviews remaining: 5 (Resolved: 0). Note that for road reviews, many of the actions required may not be entirely intuitive and for this reason its best to work with a data steward with intimate knowledge of the source data using any supplemental background provided in either the User/Algorithms guides.

[[ReferenceConflictReview]]
.Reviewing Conflicts in Hootenanny using DcGisRoads and DcTigerRoads. DigitalGlobe GlobalBasemap (GBM).
image::images/id/hoot_reviewconflict_dc.png[]

When reviewing each conflict, users can either accept the conflict 'as is' by clicking on the _Resolved_ button (shortcut = r) or modify the feature under review accordingly using the options described in previous sections covering editing feature geometry/tags.  To display the Reference (red) or Secondary (blue) review feature tags, click on either the red or blue review fields and note the tags displayed on the left panel. Note that if any geometry or tag information is subsequently modified during the review process, users will be need to click the save button to commit those changes to the database (clicking resolve will not commit any feature or tag editing modifications).  If no geometry/tag information is modified, clicking the resolve button is sufficient.   Once all reviews have been resolved, a message will pop-up in the upper right corner stating that there are no more available features to review and a Complete Review button will appear under the merged layer name. Clicking on that will allow users to either export the data using the provided layer export options or Add Another Dataset to continue with the conflation process.

.Completing the Review Process in Hootenanny. Users can choose to <<HootiD_Exporting, Export>> the data or Add another dataset to conflate.  The layer colors displayed on the map correspond to the Reference (blue for DcGisRoads) and Secondary (yellow for DcTigerRoads) layers and green for any merged features.

[[HootiD-HorizontalConflationExample]]
===== Cookie Cutter and Horizontal Conflation: Conflating Boulder, CO City Streets against OpenStreetMap data.

The example describes a cookie cutter and horizontal conflation using a Street centerline data obtained from the link:$$https://www-static.bouldercolorado.gov/docs/opendata/Streets.zip$$[City of Boulder] and a Highway dataset obtained from OSM. The figure below shows the two layers displayed on top OpenStreetMap data. The dark gray lines represents the higher quality street centerline data and red lines represent the OSM highway layers for Boulder and the surrounding area.

Zooming in with relevant imagery displayed in the background, we can see that _Streets_ layer is better aligned with the background imagery and provides better coverage in the city by including more streets and alleys whereas the OSM data provides wider coverage for the surrounding area but is less detailed.

.Verifying data on imagery. Boulder, CO; Boulder city street centerline (gray), OSM highways (red); DigitalGlobe GlobalBasemap (GBM).

When using this conflation type, the first layer (cookie-cut) will contain the reference geometry and be used to perform the cut operation. The second layer represents the dough from which the first layer is cut. The process is depicted below in <<Cookie-Cutter_conceptual_workflow>>. In the image labeled A, the input dough layer (Boulder OSM) is shown. In image B, an alpha shape is generated around the cut region defined by Layer 1, the Boulder City Road data, with a -1 km buffer applied. The process continues with the OSM dough layer "cut" using the alpha shape (image C). Finally the two layers are combined (image D).

Viewing the workflow within the Hootenanny UI, the Boulder Streets data is added as the Reference dataset and the OSM Boulder Highway dataset as the Secondary data source. The user selects _Cookie Cutter & Horizontal_ as the Conflation Type and picks a layer to represent the Attribute Reference Layer then clicks Conflate.

The final conflated layer represents the merger of the Boulder streets layer and the OSM highways data with all duplicates removed and cut roads joined. Once the conflation process has completed, the resulting dataset can be exported as a shapefile, FGDB, or WFS from the UI following the steps outlined <<Hoot-iD_Datasets,here>>.

[[Poi2PoiConflation]]
===== POI to POI conflation: Washington, D.C.

Points of Interest (POI) to POI conflation is supported within Hootenanny by default when any two layers containing POIs are added to the map. POIs are compared against one another and scored based on a variety of tag/conditions (see Algorithms/User Guide for more background on Unifying conflation scoring).

Unlike linear and polygon features, the review process for POIs provides the capability to _merge_ attribution and geometry when reviewing conflicts. Merge combines the two POIs attribution into a single POI with the reference geometry and a combination of non-reference/reference attribution. When determining an appropriate action, a user must first consider whether the points represent two separate POIs, a single POI, or an invalid POI in which case the user might move or delete the POI(s) in question.  In this example, a link:$$https://www.arcgis.com/home/item.html?id=f323f677b3f34fe08956b8fcce3ace44$$[DC POI] dataset containing locations and attributes of _Address Alias_ points composed of a variety of link:$$http://geospatial.dcgis.dc.gov/dc_kmz/metadata/AddressAliasPt.html$$[features] as part of the Master Address Repository (MAR) for the D.C. Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO) and participating D.C. government agencies is conflated against link:$$http://www.mapcruzin.com/free-united-states-shapefiles/free-district-of-columbia-arcgis-maps-shapefiles.htm$$[MapCruzin] POI data derived from OSM. Conflating these two POI datasets produces 62 reviews with a range of conflict review notes to step through and take appropriate actions of either merging or accepting as two separate POIs.

[[POI2POIConflictReview]]
.Reviewing Washington, D.C. POI conflicts in Hootenanny using the DC POI and MapCruzin data. In this case the user is determining whether the feature highlighted in blue, "Reed Elementary School", should be merged with the feature highlighted in red, "MARIE REED ELEMENTARY SCHOOL".  A red arrow appears when hovering over the merge button indicating the proposed merge direction but this can be reversed by hitting the `Ctrl` key and merge button simultaneously.

NOTE: A POI merge can occur in either direction depending on the users preference.  In most cases clicking merge will merge the secondary dataset POI into the reference POI combining relevant attributes but this can be reversed by holding down the Ctrl key when clicking the merge button.  This will not work when using the merge `m` short-cut key.

[[HootiD_GenericRiverConflation]]
===== River Conflation

One of the options available for advanced conflation is the ability to conflate River data using methods described in the Hootenanny Developer Guide in the Generic River Conflation section.  If users would like to explore this capability by conflating two rivers datasets, make sure that the River options have been enabled in the Advanced Conflation Options panel as shown in the figure below.  Note that no exact set of parameters may produce the desired results so experimentation maybe required.  Background on each options is provided in greater detail in the Developer Guide and listed in <<RiverOptions>>.

[[HootiD_PowerLineConflation]]
===== Power Line Conflation

The capability to conflate power lines exists within Hootenanny iD Editor.  It can be configured in a similar fashion as that described
for river conflation.

[[HootiD_Exporting]]
===== Export Conflated Data

After both conflation and reviews have been completed, users can export the conflated dataset using a selected translation schema and output file format. Click on the _Export Data_ button shown below to display the export configuration page.

image::images/id/hoot_export_options.png[scaledwidth="25%"]

*_Export Translation Schema_*

Users can select which translation schema (MGCP, TDS 4.0, TDS 6.1) they would like to export their data. This list will likely expand as new schemas are added to the deployed build after subsequent software releases.

*_Export Format_*

There are currently four options for exporting data from Hootenanny: File Geodatabase (FGDB), Shapefile, OSM and Web Feature Service (WFS). Note that FGDB, Shapefile, and OSM formats are exported as a zip file containing all of the relevant associated files, while WFS is exported as WFS Get Capabilities service URL that can be added into an OGC-enabled third party application (see <<HootiD_WFSExport,WFS Export>>).  There is an additional option when exporting TDS data as a FGDB to append to existing FGDB template if users would like to utilize the MILSPEC symbology available from the ESRI ArcGIS Defense Mapping extension for ArcGIS 10.2.

*_Export File Output Name_*

This is the output name of the exported file.

[[Hoot-iD_Manage]]
==== Manage Hootenanny

The _Manage_ capabilities within Hootenanny provide a set of administrative and dataset tools. For example, a user can use the _Translation Assistant_ to create a custom translation between two different tag schemas for generating agency standard products used for foundation GEOINT content. Data can also be imported/exported from the _Datasets_ settings to different file formats supported by desktop GIS applications and translated to a specific data schema to evaluate compliance to standard specifications using tools like the Geospatial Analysis Integrity Toolkit (GAIT).

This section presents an overview of the functionality in each settings page and provides a set of example workflows to showcase how the tool can be implemented using real world datasets.

Click on the _Manage_ link in the top right-hand side of the user interface.

.Manage options.  A. Settings pages, e.g. Datasets, Translation Assistant, etc..., that allow users to select different menu options for each setting.  B. The primary window for updating or interacting with elements associated with each setting. C. The toggle to return to map/manage view.
image::images/id/hoot_ui_manage.png[scaledwidth="75%"]

[[Hoot-iD_Datasets]]
===== Datasets

The Datasets settings page provides users with different options for managing data in Hootenanny including data ingest (shapefile, osm, geonames, FGDB), data management and data export from Hootenanny into pre-defined output formats and translation schemas.  To access this feature click on Datasets from the Manage Settings page.

*_Data Ingest_*

When users click on Add Data, a dialog box displaying different options for importing datasets appears. For _Import Type_, users can select a shapefile(s), filegeodatabase, .osm file, geonames text file, etc. or than can upload a .zip containing either a shapefile, filegeodatabase or .osm dataset.


IMPORTANT:  File Geodatabase files, Shapefiles and .osm datasets are now supported in .zip.  The GBD format refers to a folder containing all of the relevant geodatabase layers.  When uploading multiple files in a single zip, all features are merged into a single layer.  To avoid this behavior of merging datasets into a single layer you will need to separate the features e.g. pois, roads, buildings, etc., first and then upload each layer separately.

[[AddNewData]]
.Importing data into Hootenanny.
image::images/id/hoot_add_dataset.png[scaledwidth="75%"]

*_Import Directory_*

When users want to add multiple datasets from the same directory, Hootenanny has a feature to import geospatial data from one directory as separate datasets.  After selecting 'Import Directory', the user is presented with a form with similar options to the _Import Single Dataset_ form.  The main difference is the user will select multiple datasets from one directory with each being loaded as a separate dataset.  While the user can select multiple datasets in the _Import Single Dataset_, they will be combined into one dataset.  Each dataset will be loaded into the designated folder and with the selected translation schema.  The user also has the option to apply a custom suffix to each dataset to avoid naming conflicts or for data management.  Currently, the import directory form supports the following import types: Shapfile and OpenStreetMap (.osm or .pbf).

If there is a conflict with a dataset in the _Import Files List_, it will highlight as red.  Hovering over the dataset will reveal the issue, which can include a dataset already having the name or an unallowed character within the dataset name.  The dataset name cannot be changed in the form; the user can either change the name in the local folder or add a custom suffix.

[[AddNewDirectory]]
.Importing data into Hootenanny.
image::images/id/hoot_add_directory.png[scaledwidth="75%"]

*_Bulk Import_*

Differing from importing datasets from one directory, users can use the _Bulk Import_ tool to import datasets in separate transactions.  The user can add up to 10 rows as 10 different import jobs.  The user can select a different translation and folder path for each row.  The bulk import form also allows a user to change the layer name.  Currently, the bulk import supports the following import types: Shapefile, OpenStreetmap, Geonames, and File Geodatabase.

If there is a conflict with a dataset name it will highlight as red.  Hovering over the dataset will reveal the issue, which can include a dataset already having the name or an unallowed character within the dataset name.  The user can either change the _Save As_ name or apply a custom suffix to each dataset to avoid naming conflicts or for data management.  The custom suffix will be applied to all datasets being imported.

After starting Import, a log will appear by clicking _Show More_, which will provide the user with updates during the import process.

[[HootBulkImport]]

[[HootAddDataFromManage]]
*_Add Reference / Secondary Layer to Map_*

Once data has been ingested into Hootenanny, users can add it directly to the map from the Manage | Datasets settings page by right-clicking on a dataset and selecting Add as Reference or Secondary Dataset.

.Adding data from dataset options page.  Select either option from the right-click menu on highlighted dataset.
image::images/id/hoot_adddatafrommanage.png[scaledwidth="50%"]

NOTE: Once a Reference or Secondary dataset has been added these options will no longer be listed in the right-click menu until either have been removed from the main map.

*_Adding Folders_*

To add a new folder, click on the _Add Folder_ button and enter the name of the folder they wish to create.  Any sub folders can be created by right-clicking on the folder and selecting Add Folder or selecting a new output folder name in the add dataset menu.  When deleting a folder, all data contained in the folder and any subfolders will be deleted.

.Add folder.  Click the Add folder button to open the relevant menu options.
image::images/id/hoot_add_folder.png[scaledwidth="25%"]

*_Export Data_*

To export a dataset, right-mouse click on a dataset and select the Export Dataset option to open the Export dialog box shown in <<hootexport>>.  The various export options are discussed in detail in <<HootiD_Exporting>>.

[[right-click_export]]
.Export from dataset.
image::images/id/hoot_export_rtclick.png[scaledwidth="75%"]

NOTE: Datasets must be selected (highlighted in yellow) to export. When selecting more than one dataset only delete and move are available options.

*_Bulk Export_*

Similar to the Bulk Import tool, users can use the _Bulk Export_ tool to export up to 10 datasets at once.  The user can set translation schema and export format to each independent job.  The user will be prompted each time to 'Save the File' as is the norm with downloading files from the web.  There is currently no option to package all files in one zipped folder.

Users can also chose to export all data in a single folder (up to 10 datasets).  This will open the _Bulk Export_ form populated with the datasts found in the selected folder.

*_Other Dataset Options_*

Layers can be managed by right-clicking on selected datasets to expose different options.  Note that the options presented will depend on what is selected or highlighted.  To select more than one dataset hold the ctrl key and select each dataset.

.Manage data options available from Right-click.
image::images/id/hoot_adddatafrommanage.png[scaledwidth="50%"]

To delete, move or rename an existing dataset(s), right click over the highlighted layers and select the appropriate option.

NOTE: It is not possible to select more than one folder simultaneously.

*_Prepare for Validation_*

The Prepare for Validation option provides users with the capability of generating a 30% sample of validated POI features that can be used to determine the degree to which it can be identified using the basemap imagery data source. When using DigitalGlobe GBM/EGD data, the imagery metadata is appended to each POI indicating what image id was used to validate a given feature.  To prepare a POI layer for validation, right-click and select Prepare for Validation.  A dialog box will appear prompting users to enter a name for the layer.

.Create new validation layer.  Enter an output name and click run to generate the validation layer.
image::images/id/hoot_prepareforvalidation.png[scaledwidth="25%"]

Once complete, users can load this newly generated validation layer and Hootenanny will popup a prompt to go into Validation mode whereby three validation options are presented.  Each presented option (either 1, 2, or 3) when selected will populate different hoot:review:choices tags as well as any imagery source metadata if used.

.Confirmed: You can look at the point in the imagery and determine what it is (e.g. a mosque, airport, stadium, etc.) Shortcut key = 1.

.Assessed: You can determine that the point is a building from the imagery but you cannot verify its type (e.g. hair salon, coffee shop, etc..). Shortcut key = 2.

.Reported: You cannot determine the point using the provided imagery (missing coverage, clouds, etc.). Shortcut key = 3.

.Validating a layer of Washington, D.C. Points of Interest in Hootenanny against the DigitalGlobe GBM/EGD basemap.
image::images/id/hoot_validate_layer.png[scaledwidth="75%"]

NOTE: Panning the map during Validation causes the highlighted POI to become unselected and removes the validation options. To resume validation, click the Select button at the bottom.

[[TranslationAssistant]]
===== Translation Assistant

The Translation Assistant was developed to facilitate the translation of "shoebox" (one-off or custom) datasets into Hootenanny’s internal format of OSM xml. Users must map attribute names and values from the source dataset to a common schema so that conflation operations can occur. The available target schemas in the current release include OSM and TDSv61. The choice of target schema is dependent on the users fluency with said schema and how conversant they will be in defining an accurate mapping, as well as technical factors noted below. All translations end up in the internal OSM schema when stored in the database and used during conflation operations.

NOTE:  Validation for some schemas, such as TDS, is more strict (does not support ad hoc tag key=values) and it only supports one FCODE type per layer. Other schemas may produce lossy results in certain directions, such as translating from OSM to TDS during export. For example, OSM will be a lossless translation target format, but if in the end, the conflated datasets will be exported to TDS, then defining the translation mapping in TDS should guarantee that mapped fields remain lossless.

The Translation Assistant provides users with a UI driven tool to merge and translate datasets with varying schemas into common data models using standard tag schemas (OSM, TDS, etc.). The output generated from the Translation Assistant is a custom translation script that will be used to prepare data for the conflation feature matching process.

To access the Translation Assistant, click on the Manage button and then the Translation Assistant settings page to open, as shown in the figure below.

.Translation Assistant
image::images/id/hoot_TA_open.png[scaledwidth="60%"]

To begin the process, users select the tag schema they want to use to define the translation mapping in. The translation schema can be changed at any time, but unexpected results may occur if more than one tag schema is used to define a single translation script.

Users must upload the dataset files for which they want to define a translation. If the _Upload file(s)_ dialog is open, files chosen can be one or more shapefiles, consisting of .shp, .shx, and .dbf components at a minimum; or a zip file containing one or more shapefiles, or a folder that is a file geodatabase. If the _Upload folder_ dialog is opened, the chosen folder can contain one or more shapefiles or be a file geodatabase.

NOTE:  If the uploaded dataset contains more than one Feature Class a drop-down will be added to the UI and translation mappings can be defined per Feature Class.  At minimum, an FCODE e.g. AL015 or feature type e.g. highway = road is required for each feature class in order to save the translation file.

The translation mappings are defined at the attribute level and support one-to-one, one-to-many and many-to-one attribute-tag associations. To better illustrate the utility of this tool, a walk through example is provided using the Washington, D.C. Street Centerline data downloaded from DCGIS Open Data's data catalog (http://opendata.dc.gov/). For this example we will be using a downloaded link:$$http://opendata.dc.gov/datasets/f3b0c6a6ff5f4493b85d858e67b7400b_43.zip$$[shapefile] from the site and mapping it to the OSM Tag Schema.

*_One to One Mappings_*

In its simplest form, a translation mapping takes a field name and maps it to a tag key. Field values become tag values with no transformation. In this example the source dataset attribute, _ST_NAME_, is mapped to the OSM tag, `name` by typing/autofill name in the field. The same process can be repeated for the attribute, _REGISTERED_, mapped to the OSM tag, `alt_name`.

.One to One Tag Key Mapping. _ST_NAME_ in the source data is mapped to the OSM tag, `name`.
image::images/id/hoot_TA_one-to-one.png[scaledwidth="25%"]

The next form involves mapping specific attribute field values to specific tag values, in addition to translating the field name to a tag key. For this example (and many others), the process of mapping attributes may involve some additional research into the proper definitions for road classifications. In some cases, attributes from source data may not have direct 1:1 relationship to OSM tags so `best match` approaches are often taken at the discretion of the analyst performing the translation. Using the link::$$http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/processes/statewide/related/highway_functional_classifications/fcauab.pdf$$[Highway Functional Classification] from the Department of Transportation, we can attempt to map the values to their link::$$http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Highways$$[OSM tag] equivalents.

.One to One Tag Key:Value Mapping. _FUNCTIONAL_ is mapped to the OSM tag, highway, with each value set appropriately.
image::images/id/hoot_TA_one-to-one_key-value.png[scaledwidth="25%"]

*_One to Many Mappings_*

One to many mappings are supported by clicking on the plus button after each new tag association has been added for a given attribute. The figure below shows a one to many mapping for the `ROUNDABOUT` field and maps to the OSM tags `junction=roundabout` and implies `oneway=true`. Note that this field is not present in the DC Street Centerline data and is simply used here as an example.

.One to Many Mapping Example.
image::images/id/hoot_TA_one-to-many.png[scaledwidth="25%"]

*_Many to One Mappings_*

Many to one mappings are supported with the Translation Assistant UI based on the OSM semi-colon value separator. The purpose of this is to allow the user to retain any fields in their shoebox dataset that would otherwise be dropped due to the lack of a corresponding tag in the target schema. The special tag key used for this feature is `extra_attributes`. All attributes mapped to this tag will be concatenated together. An example tag is `extra_attributes=speed_mph=45;city=District of Columbia;country=US`.

NOTE:  Support for this extra_attributes tag does not exist in some export schemas such as TDS. If an export schema does support the concept of a catch-all field such as _notes_ or other, Hootenanny can add support for it in the export translation capability.

*_TDS Schema_*

A key distinction when doing translations with OSM tag schemas versus the Topographic Data Store (TDS) schema is that the TDS defines feature types based on `FCODE` values. To support this within the Translation Assistant, the user must select the appropriate FCODE type using a drop-down menu of possible supported TDS feature types and proceed with the schema mapping. This FCODE restricts the set of available tags and is assumed to apply to every feature in the layer.

NOTE:  The TDS translation option only supports one feature type per translation layer.

===== Notional Custom Translation Example: Washington, D.C. Street Centerlines

To start a custom translation in the Translation Assistant select the appropriate tag schema, which in this case is OSM. Then click on the _Upload file(s)_ button select the `Street_Centerlines_-_Light.shp`, `Street_Centerlines_-_Light.shx`, and `Street_Centerlines_-_Light.dbf` files. Once loaded, the Translation Assistant displays that this particular file contains 36 attributes and the user has the option of mapping all or a select number of them to their corresponding OSM tag. For each attribute in the file, the user has the following options:

* Create an attribute mapping. Users add a new tag relationship by clicking on the plus sign and typing the name of the corresponding tag to add in the field.
* Save the mapping. Users click Next to save a mapping and advance to the next attribute.
* Ignore the attribute. Users click the Ignore button to ignore that attribute in the translation.
* Skip the attribute. Users click on the backward or forward arrows next to each attribute name (e.g. < 2 of 36 > ), to skip past that attribute.

NOTE: You must select either Ignore or Next to save a mapping for an attribute. Using the arrow icons to skip the attribute will cause any unsaved mappings for that attribute to be lost.

The first attribute presented in this translation is _DESCRIPTION_ which is a local functional street classification system. The closest OSM tag for this `ref:road:type` which supports values such as `avenue`, `boulevard`, `circle`, etc. Proceeding the next attribute, _DIRECTIONALITY_, this maps to the OSM key `oneway` whose values are `oneway=yes/no`. In this case you can simply set any value with One Way to `yes` and Two way to `no`. The vast majority of the attributes are unique the DCGIS Open Data format and can therefore be ignored by clicking the Ignore button. An X will now appear in the box next to each ignored field indicating that it will be ignored in the translation file. Moving through the attributes, another field of interest is _FUNCTIONAL_, a feature class code that denotes highway functional class of the road based on link::$$http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/planning/processes/statewide/related/highway_functional_classifications/fcauab.pdf$$[NHS standards]. For this example, the user should type the OSM tag `highway` and then expand the value options to set each _FUNCTIONAL_ value to the appropriate highway tag by clicking on the taxonomy icon next to the field. For each unique value you'll need to create the appropriate mapping so for instance in this case, _Collector_ could map to `tertiary`, _Interstate_ to `primary`, _Local_ to `unclassified` _Minor Arterial_ to `secondary`, _Other Freeway and Expressway_ to `motorway` and _Principal Arterial_ to `primary`. Click 'Next' to save the mapping.

Attributes such as _OWNERSHIP_, _STNAME_, _SHAPE_LENGTH_, and _REGISTERED_ represent fields where you would want the attribute value to correspond directly to the tag value, e.g. `NAME=Main St. -> Geographic Name Information : Full Name=Main. St.`. These fields can be mapped to the OSM tags, `ownership`, `name`, `length` and `alt_name`, respectively.

NOTE:  After entering name, the user can either press Tab or Enter to select the first option or click the desired option from the list. To register a tag key not found in the lookup press Tab or Enter. To register a tag key that is a substring of a lookup key, use the Backspace button to remove the auto-completed portion of the string and press Tab or Enter. To dismiss an incomplete tag key press Escape. To remove a defined tag mapping click the X icon.

Once all attributes have been either mapped or ignored, a _Save Translation_ button will appear at the bottom indicating that the translation is populated with enough values to be functional (when mapping to TDS tag schema at minimum users must have at least one feature type mapped to an F_CODE before they are prompted to save the translation). Users can review the expanded list of tag mappings by clicking on each attribute name under the attribute number bar. A check will appear for all mapped attributes and a X for all ignored.

.The translation mapping can be saved once all attributes have been defined. 'X' boxes indicate ignored attributes while checked boxes are mapped.
image::images/id/hoot_TA_save_trans.png[scaledwidth="25%"]

When the user is satisfied that their translation is sufficiently populated with enough defined tag mappings, they can click on the Save Translation button and a pop-up message will appear asking whether you would like to add it to the list of available internal translations.  Clicking OK will open the _New Translation_ dialog box with the generated translation file in Javascript.  Provide a name and description then Save Edits to save the translation.  This translation file will now be available to use for importing new data as discussed in <<Hoot-iD_Datasets>>.

[[Advanced_Conflation_Options]]
==== Appendix: Hootenanny Advanced Parameters

The following advanced configuration parameters are provided to the user via the Advanced Conflation option.

[[Advanced_Cleaning_Options]]
===== Cleaning Options

* *Enabled*: allows map cleaning operators to be applied during conflation.
* *Remove Duplicate Way*: Remove duplicate ways (lines) that are exact duplicates. If the lines partially overlap with exactly the same geometry then only the partial overlap is removed from the more complex geometry.
* *Duplicate Name Remover Case Sensitive*: Removes duplicate names when their case also matches otherwise ignore case when removing.
* *Remove Superfluous Way*: Remove all ways that contain no nodes or all the nodes are exactly the same.
* *Remove Unlikely Intersections*: Remove implied intersections that are likely incorrect. For example, a motorway overpass intersecting a residential street at a 90° is considered unlikely and "unsnapped". The geometry location is not modified.
* *DualWay Splitter*: Split highway types that are marked as divided into two separate geometries marked as oneway roads. A number of assumptions must be made to do this including assumptions about the direction of travel on roads (right or left hand drivers).
* *Implied Divided Marker*: If two roads implicitly should be marked as divided based on the surrounding roads, mark it as such. This is primarily caused by the FACC+ spec which does not allow bridges to be marked as divided.
* *Small Way Merger*: Merge any ludicrously small ways that have essentially the same attributes. Things like `UUID` are ignored. See `small.highway.merger.threshold` for setting the threshold value.
* *Small Way Merger Threshold*: If highways are smaller than threshold and the tags matched then they will be merged together into a single way.
* *Remove Empty Areas*: Remove all area elements that have a area of zero.
* *Remove Duplicate Areas*: Remove any area elements that are essentially the same.
* *Remove No Information Element*: Remove any elements that don't have any tags with information. (E.g. only contains UUID and source, but not FCODE equivalent or other informative tags).

[[RubberSheetingOptions]]
===== Rubber Sheeting Options

* *Enabled*: Enables Rubber Sheeting options.
* *Rubber Sheet Ref*: Provides a rubber sheet transform for moving input 2 towards input 1. If not enabled, both inputs are moved towards each other.
* *Rubber Sheet Minimum Ties*: Sets the minimum number of tie points that will be used when calculating a rubber sheeting solution.

[[GeneralConflationOptions]]
===== General Conflation Options

* *Unify Optimizer Time Limit*: The maximum amount of time in seconds to wait for the optimizer to complete. A value of -1 makes the time limit unlimited. If this value is set to something other than -1 your conflation results may change between multiple runs. Especially if the machine Hoot is running on is under heavy load. If the "CM Score:" value is changing between runs and GLPK isn't finding an optimal solution then this is likely causing different output. Just because the output is changing doesn't mean it is wrong, but this can be problematic if you're doing testing or expecting repeatable output for other
* *OGR Split O2S*: If the list of o2s tags is > 255 char, split it into into 254 char long pieces. If this is false, it will be exported as one big string.
* *OGR TDS Add FCSubtype*: Add the ESRI specific FCSUBTYPE field to the output.
* *OGR TDS Structure*: Exports TDS data in Thematic Groups (TransportationGroundCrv, StructurePnt etc) instead of one FCODE per file/layer (ROAD_L, BUILDING_P etc).

[[RoadOptions]]
===== Road Options

* *Engines*

** *Unify*: Unify incorporates more recent conflation algorithms that process the routines into a single process flow and flag reviewable items to the user. This is the default conflation engine.
** *Disabled*: Disables the road conflation engine altogether.
** *Greedy*: Uses 'Greedy' optimization to determine a good set of matches based on conflation routine designs from 2012 (See Hootenanny - Algorithms Guide for more background). This approach only deals with roads and does not flag questionable situations as reviews. Conceptual it uses the following steps

.Find the best unconflated road match between two maps
.Merge the matched roads and mark the result as conflated
.Repeat

(if `Unify` enabled):

* *Search Radius Highway*: The search radius to use when conflating highways. If two features are within the search radius then they will be considered for conflation. If the value is -1 then the circular error will be used to calculate an appropriate search radius.
* *Highway Matcher Heading Delta*: The distance around a point on a way to look when calculating the heading. A larger value will smooth out the heading values on a line. A smaller value will make the heading values correspond directly to the heading on the way at that point. This is primarily used in subline matching. Values are in meters.
* *Highway Matcher Max Angle*: Sets that maximum angle that is still considered a highway match. Units in degrees.
* *Way Merger Min Split Size*: The minimum size that a way should be split into for merging. Units in meters.

[[BuildingOptions]]
===== Building Options

* *Enabled*: Enables building conflation options.
* *Search Radius Building*: The search radius to use when conflating buildings. Currently not implemented.

[[POIOptions]]
===== POI Options

* *Enabled*: Enables POI conflation options.
* *POI Options*: POI conflation engine to be used.

** *Unify*: Conflates POIs with Unify algorithm routines into a single process flow and flag reviewable items to the user. See Hootenanny - Algorithms Guide for more detail.
** *Disabled*: Disables the POI conflation options.

[[RiverOptions]]
===== River Options
The River options have been pre-populated with default values based on generic river matching work discussed in the Hootenanny - Developer Guide. These can be modified if the user has deeper familiarity with the parameters. River options are disabled by default.

* *Enabled*: Enables river conflation options below.
* *River Angle Sample Distance*: Distance used for sampling during angle histogram extraction with the SampledAngleHistogramExtractor. Values are in meters.
* *River Matcher Heading Delta*: The distance around a point on a way to look when calculating the heading. A larger value will smooth out the heading values on
a line. A smaller value will make the heading values correspond directly to the heading on the way at that point. This is primarily
used in subline matching. Values are in meters.
* *River Auto Calc Search Radius*: Auto calculates the search radius using the circular error.
* *Search Radius River*: Search radius value to override the auto calculated radius. River Auto Calc Search Radius must be unchecked to enter value.
* *River Rubber Sheet Minimum Ties*: Minimum tie points to use for rubber sheeting.
* *River Rubber Sheet Ref*: Provides a rubber sheet transform for moving input 2 towards input 1. If not enabled, both inputs are moved towards each other.
