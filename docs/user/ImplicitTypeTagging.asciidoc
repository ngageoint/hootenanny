== Implicit Type Tagging Based On Name

Hootenanny has the capability to derive type tag information automatically for elements based soley on the contents of their name tags.  
This feature can be used simply to add better tags to poorly typed data or to add tags with the goal of improving conflated output 
between datasets.  

This feature should not be used unless the addition of some false type tags to the input data is acceptable.  There are no metrics 
yet for how many false tags this technique will generate on average, although the number is typically small and will become smaller 
over time as the feature is refined.

The default implicit feature tagger is `hoot::ImplicitPoiPolygonTypeTagger`, which will tag POIs and building/POI related polygons.  You
can use any tagger class that inherits from `hoot::ImplicitTypeTaggerBase`, however, it should be an implementation that works with the
class used as the element filter specified by the `implicit.tagging.element.criterion` when creating the implicit tag rules database.

To use the feature from the command line with your input data:

--------------------------
hoot convert -D convert.ops=hoot::ImplicitPoiPolygonTypeTagger input.osm output.osm
--------------------------

To use the feature from the command line during conflation:

------------------------
hoot conflate -D conflate.pre.ops="hoot::BuildingOutlineRemoveOp;hoot::MapCleaner;hoot::ImplicitPoiPolygonTypeTagger" input1.osm input2.osm output.osm
------------------------

NOTE: In the above command, `hoot::ImplicitPoiPolygonTypeTagger` was appended to the default operations for `conflate.pre.ops` configuration option.  Check your version of Hootenanny configuration options to find the default value for this option.

Features modified by the implicit feature tagger are marked with the tag `hoot:implicitTags:tagsAdded` to let you know what tags were 
added to the data and which name tags triggered the additions.  If you have suggestions on how to improve the quality of the 
implicit feature tagging, please contact the Hootenanny Development Team.
