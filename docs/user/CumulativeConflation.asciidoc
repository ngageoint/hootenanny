[[CumulativeConflation]]
==== Cumulative Conflation

The term Cumulative Conflation refers to a process by which more than two map inputs are conflated
into a single output. Work in this area is currently experimental, and an example script which 
illustrates this concept and allows for conflating inputs in parallel can be found 
https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny/blob/master/scripts/core/ConflateCumulative.sh[here].
