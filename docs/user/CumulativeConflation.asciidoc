=== Cumulative Conflation

The term Cumulative Conflation refers to a process by which more than two map inputs can be conflated
into a single output simultaneously. Work in this area is currently experimental, and an example 
script which illustrates this concept and allows for conflating inputs in parallel can be found 
https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny/blob/master/scripts/conflate/ConflateDirectory.sh[here].
