== History

Hootenanny was spawned out of the need for a fully automated conflation capability to support an effort to load a mix of national and city scale datasets. While ingesting customer data it quickly became apparent that multiple data sets contained redundant data that was getting rendered as duplicate geometries and exported in a similar fashion. Developing a set of automated/semi-automated conflation tools became a consistent discussion topic spawning the evolution of the Hootenanny.  In the process, the need to support an array of customer specific data schemas in addition to OSM became quickly apparent which gave rise to another capability which was the ability to translate data between different product standard schemas such as the Multinational Geospatial Co-production Program (MGCP) TRD3&4, NSG Topographic Data Store (TDS) v4.0, v. 6.1, and OSM. We have since matured the product into a stand-alone web-based application that sits on top of an extensible set of core conflation algorithms and data translation tools which are accessed via both standards-based protocols such as the OGC's Web Feature Service, Node.js and REST services in addition to the standard Javascript development resources that can be leveraged for the D3.js based user interface environment. 

=== Phase I

Following discussions related to the Perty evaluation, funding was allocated through NGA's InnoVision to further the development of Hootenanny. This development funded the R&D necessary to take Hootenanny from a research tool to a demonstrable tool that can be used by users. The majority of the work centered around RESTful and OGC web services, modifying the iD UI for conflation, translation of additional data sets and increasing conflation performance and features. 

=== Phase II

On September 1, 2014 Phase II began with the focus on enhancing the usability of Hootenanny, integrating with other systems and increasing the breadth of features that can be conflated.  One of the central goals of this phase was to release Hootenanny to the Open Source community.
