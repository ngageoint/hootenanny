== Schema Files

Internally Hootenanny stores all data in the OSM schema (plus some additional
atypical tags). Using this schema provides us with the flexibility to add new
tags as needed, but also provides the structure necessary to answer questions
such as:

* "Is `building=church` similar to `amenity=place_of_worship`?"
* "What data type is stored in this tag?"
* "Is this feature considered to be a building?"
* "Is this way a linear or area geometry?"

However, to answer such questions we must have knowledge of OSM's tags baked
into Hootenanny. To provide this the tag information is stored in schema files
found in a set of JSON files in `$HOOT_HOME/conf/schema/`. These files contains
several pieces of information:

* The text associated with the tag. E.g. `amenity=cinema`
* `isA` and `similarTo` relationships with other tags.
* The type of value stored in the tag (e.g. real number, enumerated text, etc.)
* The geometries that might be associated with the tag.
* The relative influence of the tag -- though this is not being used much.
* Any categories that the tag may be part of (e.g. POI, building,
  transportation).

=== File Format

Each file is formatted as a JSON file. The top-most file is `schema.json`.
`schema.json` contains some of the earliest schema definitions from hootenanny
and also imports the other schema files. Most of the schema files that are
imported are broken out by the key in the tag. E.g. `amenity`, `barrier`,
`building`, etc.

In the following examples the schema has been simplified for illustrative
purposes. Please see the raw schema files for more details.

Each tag is represented as an object in the JSON file. For instance:

-----
...
"#": "Any 'tag' that starts with the hash (#) as a key will be ignored as though
it is a comment."
"tag": {
  "name": "highway",
  "influence": 1.0,
  "type": "enumeration",
  "categories": ["transporation"]
},
...
-----

In this case the name `highway` represents the name of the tag. Influence gives
a value of 1 (not really used anymore). Type is `enumeration` meaning that the
tag will contain one of a series of meaningful words. The tag is part of the
`transportation` category.

You'll note that no geometry was given. This is because each highway tag may
have a different geometry type. For example `highway=road` is a `linestring` and
`highway=bus_stop` is generally a point.

The tag above tells us very little information about the `highway` tag, but
Hootenanny uses `isA` relationships in the schema files to denote inheritance,
and the `highway` tag's children will tell us a great deal. For instance:

-----
...
"tag": {
  "name": "highway=road",
  "isA": "highway",
  "geometries": ["linestring"]
},
...
-----

By specifying a isA relationship between `highway=road` and `highway` the
`highway=road` tag gets (or inherits) all the `highway=road` attributes for
free. The `highway=road` tag can then override only the relevant attributes. So
the snippet above is equivalent to:

-----
...
"tag": {
  "name": "highway=road",
  "isA": "highway",
  "influence": 1.0,
  "type": "enumeration",
  "categories": ["transporation"],
  "geometries": ["linestring"]
},
...
-----

This also denotes that a `highway=road` is a highway so if the code needs to
know about roads it can answer the question "Is a `highway=road` a `highway`?
Yes."

We can further expand on this by inheriting from `highway=road` and introducing
the `similarTo` relationship.

----
...
"tag": {
  "name": "highway=motorway",
  "isA": "highway=road",
  "similarTo": { "name": "highway=trunk", "weight": 0.8 },
},
"tag":
{
  "name": "highway=trunk",
  "isA": "highway=road",
},
...
-----

In the cases above we have two new tags that inherit from `highway=road`. They
also list that `highway=motorway` is similar to `highway=trunk`. This
relationship is reciprocal. So it is also implied that `highway=trunk` is
similar to `highway=motorway`.

With this new information Hootenanny can answer "Is `highway=motorway` similar
to `highway=trunk`? Yes, with a weight of 0.9." Since we know `highway=motorway` is
a `highway=road` we can also answer "Is `highway=motorway` similar to
`highway=road`? Yes, with a weight of 1.0." In this case since a motorway is a
road then they are absolutely similar. However the inverse is not necessarily
true. A road is not necessarily a motorway which can be an important distinction
when traversing the graph.

The actual highway relationships can be viewed in the image below. Blue lines
represent `isA` relationships and green lines represent `similarTo`
relationships:

There are many more intricacies to the schema file format and how the internal
structure is built. If you would like more information please post to the GitHub
site.

=== Visualizing the Graph

The schema at the time of this writing has nearly 1200 tags defined and nearly
1600 relationships between those tags. This is difficult to visualize. However,
you can generate a graph of the schema to view and manipulate with the following
steps from the command line:

. Go to the `$HOOT_HOME` directory and type `make tmp/schema.dot`
. Install http://gephi.github.io/[Gephi] using the instructions on the website.
. Start Gephi
. Click _Open Graph File..._
. Browse to `$HOOT_HOME/tmp/` and select `schema.dot`.
. Click _Overview_
. In the _Layout_ choose the _Frucheterman Reingold_ layout
. Choose _Gravity_ of .1 and _Speed_ of 100.
. Click _Run_
. Zoom out with the mouse wheel till you see the whole graph, when it stabilizes 
  change gravity to .5 and hit enter.
. When that stabilizes, increase the gravity again, reduce the speed and
  continue in that fashion until you have a gravity of about 1 and speed of 1.
. Click _Stop_.
. When the graph looks good, click the _Preview_ button at the top.
. Change the options on the left to achieve a look you like and then export.

Alternatively you can use graphviz to visualize the results, but I think the
Gephi results look much better.
