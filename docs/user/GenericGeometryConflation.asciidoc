== Generic Geometry Conflation

Hootenanny uses machine learning techniques, customizable scripts, and flexible configuration options to develop algorithms that will yield 
good conflated output for a given type of data (roads, buildings, etc.). If a type of map data is encountered for which Hootenanny has no
specific conflation algorithm available, that data will be conflated with Generic Geometry Conflation scripts. This ensures that all data in
an input map has a chance to be conflated. 

A separate script exists for geometry type Hootenanny conflates. The scripts are:

* `Line.js`
* `Point.js`
* `Polygon.js`
* `PointPolygon.js`

The scripts use very simple techniques to attempt to conflate data, including Euclidean distance matching and type tag similarity scoring. 
Related configuration options include the `search.generic.*` and `generic.*` options.
