== Code Documentation

Class documentation is used to build displayable documentation with doxygen. At a minimum, all 
public class members that are not simple getters or setters should be documented. Protected/private 
members may be documented on an as needed basis but will not be documented by doxygen. Qt Creator 
will autocreate documentation templates for classes and method when you type `/**` and press enter.

Class documentation should look something like this:

-----
@brief The WaySublineRemover class removes a sublines from ways.

Optional other info a couple lines down...
-----

Public bethod documentation should look something like this:

-----
/**
  * @brief removeSubline removes a subline from a way.
   
    Optional other info a couple lines down...
  * @param way the way to modify
  * @param subline the subline in the way to remove
  * @param map the map owning the way
  * @return IDs of the ways created and added back to the map as a result of the subline removal
  */
  static std::vector<ElementId> removeSubline(
    const WayPtr& way, const WaySubline& subline, OsmMapPtr& map);
-----

Public variable documentation should look something like this:

-----
/** This integer variable is documented. */
static int MY_INT;

/// This integer variable is documented.
static int MY_INT;
