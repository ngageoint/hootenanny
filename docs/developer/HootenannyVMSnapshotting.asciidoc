== Snapshotting the Hootenanny Vagrant VM

* To install snapshotting for vbox:
** run: 'vagrant plugin install vagrant-vbox-snapshot'
* To do partial provisioning (before first VM use): 
** uncomment the 'exit 0' line below
** run: 'vagrant up' - The lengthy (usually more stable), repo based install part of the provisioning gets done.
* To snaphot after partial provisioning and test remainder of provisioning: 
** comment out the 'exit 0' line below
** run: 'vagrant snapshot save hoot-partially-provisioned && vagrant provision' - The remaining, not quite as lengthy (sometimes less stable) hoot specific provisioning then gets done.
* To restore the partially provisioned VM snapshot at a later time: 
** run: 'vagrant snapshot restore hoot-partially-provisioned'
