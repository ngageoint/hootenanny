== Hootenanny Development Environment Setup Instructions

You have two options:

*Option #1*

Use a Vagrant VM to setup the Hootenanny application without any development tools, and either install your custom development tools on the VM or use development tools already installed on your local machine to interact with the VM.  See the Vagrant VM setup instructions provided at: https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny/blob/master/VAGRANT.md for details.

*Option #2*

If you want to build a development environment completely on bare metal for the highest possible performance, download https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny/blob/develop/scripts/InstallHootDevelopmentEnvironment.sh to your home directory and follow the instruction in the script to run it.

The choice of development tools is personal, so you may want to tweak the script a bit.  In addition to development tools, the script also adds Hadoop support.
