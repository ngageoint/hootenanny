== Code Style

=== Core

The file `conf/core/QtCreatorStyle.xml` should take care of settings up most of the styling for you. 
Here are the highlights:

* Class names use Pascal Case: `MyClass`.
* Method names use Camel Case: `myMethod`.
* Private method names are prepended with an underscore: `_myPrivateMethod`.
* Non-const private variable names use Camel Case and an underscore: `_myVar`.
* Const variable names use all capitals and an underscore: `MY_CONSTANT`.
* Indents are two spaces.
* Braces are put on lines separate from code.
* There are no spaces between parameters: `dontDoThis( var )` and `doThis(var)`.
* There is a limit of 100 spaces per line (this is negotiable). This supports individuals who 
rotate their screens vertically.
