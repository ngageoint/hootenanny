== Hootenanny Development Process

* Open a GitHub issue for the new feature to be worked on.
* Perform work for the feature on a new git feature branch derived from the master branch and named with the number of the 
GitHub issue that was opened.
* Ensure your changes match the [Hootenanny code style]:(https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny/blob/master/docs/developer/HootenannyCodeStyle.asciidoc).
* Ensure your changes are [properly documented]:(https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny/blob/master/docs/developer/HootenannyCodeDocumentation.asciidoc) with code comments and corresponding updates to the User Guide.
* Ensure your changes are [adequately tested]:(https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny/blob/master/docs/developer/HootenannyTests.asciidoc) via CPPUnit, conflate case, or command line tests.
* [Open a pull request](https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny/pulls) to merge the feature branch into the master branch 
and assign at least one individual to review the changes before merging.
* Correct test failures if necessary.
* Check the quality of your changes using [Sonar](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=hoot) and improve them as necessary 
before merging.
* Once the pull request is approved, all tests are passing, and all [Sonar](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=hoot) issues 
have been dealt with, merge the pull request.
* Check the status of the nightly regression tests the following day and fix failing regression tests if necessary.
