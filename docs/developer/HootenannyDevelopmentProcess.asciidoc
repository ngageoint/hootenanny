== Hootenanny Development Process

* Open a GitHub issue for the new feature to be worked on and assign it to yourself.
* Perform work for the feature on a new git feature branch derived from the master branch and named with the number of the 
GitHub issue that was opened.
* Ensure your changes follow the https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny/blob/master/docs/developer/HootenannyCodeBestPractices.asciidoc[coding best practices].
* Ensure your changes match the https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny/blob/master/docs/developer/HootenannyCodeStyle.asciidoc[Hootenanny code style].
* Ensure your changes are https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny/blob/master/docs/developer/HootenannyCodeDocumentation.asciidoc[properly documented] with code comments and corresponding updates to the User Guide.
* Ensure your changes are https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny/blob/master/docs/developer/HootenannyTests.asciidoc[adequately tested]. While we have no official test coverage required and 100% test coverage is not absolutely required, you should be able to get 90%-95% coverage most of the time. (TODO: link to generated test coverage report)
* https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny/pulls[Open a pull request] to merge the feature branch into the master branch and assign it to yourself.
* Correct test failures if necessary.
* Check the quality of your changes using https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=hoot[Sonar] and improve them as necessary 
before merging.
* Request at least on individual to review your pull request.
* Once the pull request has been approved by the reviewer(s), all tests are passing, and all https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=hoot[Sonar] issues have been dealt with, merge the pull request.
* Check the status of the nightly regression tests the following day and fix failing regression tests if necessary.
