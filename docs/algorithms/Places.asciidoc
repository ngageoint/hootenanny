=== PLACES POI Conflation

The following sections describe the attempt to emulated PLACES point conflation
and provides some simple examples of data processing.

NOTE: This implementation was based on PLACES as of 3/11/2014 and has been removed from Hootenanny as of November 2016. Regular updates
are not being made to the PLACES algorithm within Hootenanny. Unifying POI Conflation is now the default in Hootenanny and is recommended in most situations.

Hootenanny now provides a simple function for performing point-based conflation.
This only provides point to point conflation (no point to polygon) and uses
names and geometry for matching criteria. An attempt has been made to mimic
PLACES conflation as closely as is reasonable. PLACES provides a lot of
functionality that is not available through Hootenanny such as user workflows
and a convenient web interface for editing and distributing point data. PLACES
also maintains a database of all the conflated results with links to the source
data. These sections are only concerned with the POI conflation and do not
address the database, web interface or persisting source data.

==== PLACES Conflation Process

The conflation process is a rule based approach to determining point matches and
then merging those matches into a single feature. Because there may be features
that are duplicates within data sets as well as between data sets the first step
is a Self-Conflation (intra-dataset), followed by Challenge-Conflation
(inter-dataset). When both steps are complete a final conflated data set is
produced as a series of links between records as well as a new record with the
best geometry and all referenced names.

_Self-Conflation_

1. Name Conflation - Match and merge POIs where there is an exact latitude/longitude and name match.
2. Place Conflation - Match and merge POIs where there is an exact latitude/longitude match and name does not have to be the same.
3. Accuracy Conflation - Match and merge _inaccurate_ POIs with other POIs using goodness (defined below).
4. Name Conflation - Repeats the process in step 2.
5. Goodness Conflation - Match and merge all POIs using goodness.
6. Name Conflation - Repeats the process in step 2.

_Challenge-Conflation_

Challenge conflation contains the same steps as Self-Conflation but performs them in a different order and works on the result of the two Self-Conflated data sets rather than within a single data set.

1. Name Challenge - Match and merge POIs where there is an exact latitude/longitude and name match.
2. Accuracy Challenge - Match and merge _inaccurate_ POIs with other POIs using goodness (defined below).
3. Goodness Challenge - Match and merge _accurate_ POIs with _accurate_ POIs using goodness.
4. Place Challenge - Match and merge POIs where there is an exact latitude/longitude match and name does not have to be the same.
5. Challenge NoMatch - Insert unmatched data from the challenge dataset into the base dataset.

===== Goodness

Goodness is a concept in the PLACES code for determining if two points are a
match or not. It is based on rules for geometric distance as well as edit
distance between names. If both the names are considered close enough and the
distance is considered close enough then the points are merged. The sections
below describe the algorithms used to determine these matches.

Point Accuracy

Each point is classified as either accurate or inaccurate based on the point location of the data. If the point rounds to the nearest arcminute then it is considered inaccurate. Otherwise it is considered accurate.

Geometry Matching

If the distance between the two points is less than _x_ distance then the POIs are candidates for matching.

_x_ is determined based on the inaccurate/accurate class of the POI. If the POI is _inaccurate_ then x is 56km. If the POI is _accurate_ then _x_ is 1km.

Name Matching

A Levenshtein Similarity score is calculated for each candidate POI. To calculate the similarity the highest scoring similarity of all name combinations is used where Levenshtein Similarity is defined as:

* M - The maximum length of the two strings.

Calculating Goodness

Goodness is calculated as:

* G - Goodness
* d - The distance between the points
* dmax - The maximum allowable distance between the points (e.g. 56km for inaccurate and 1km for accurate)
* wd - Weight of d [0, 1] (defaults to .1)
* s - The Levenshtein similarity score
* ws - Weight of s [0, 1] (defaults to .9)

Any goodness score greater than or equal to a threshold is considered a match. The threshold defaults to 0.3.

===== Merge Matched Records

If one record is considered accurate and the other is not, then the accurate
geometry is used as the geometry for both names. Otherwise the chosen geometry
is arbitrary. All names are carried over to the newly merged record along with
links such that the original data can be retrieved for any conflated record. The
Name Conflation portion of the algorithm removes duplicate names at the same
point, while retaining all other associated information.

==== Hootenanny's PLACES Conflation

In the POI conflation code Hootenanny attempts to follow the PLACES approach
closely but rather than perform both a Self-Conflation and Challenge-Conflation
step, Hootenanny conflates all the data as a single step. This may introduce
some differences with the PLACES conflation process. A discussion occurs at the
end of the document as well as some potential solutions to the problems.

===== Geometry Matching

With regards to an exact geometry match, Hootenanny defines an exact geometry
match as any two points that are within \~1mm to avoid minor floating point
precision errors. Rather than explicitly specifying _inaccurate_ and _accurate_
data types, Hootenanny supports an configurable column that specifies the
circular error (CE) of a feature in meters. Hootenanny uses that to define the
threshold of a geometry match. Typically Hootenanny uses the sum of the two
circular error values as the threshold, but for PLACES compatibility it uses the
maximum of the two values as the threshold. It is expected that the input data
will have this field populated with either 56km or 1km as appropriate.

===== POI Merging

When two or more features are identified as matching, they are grouped into a
set. The feature with the lowest CE is used as merged geometry and adopt that
geometry's CE. At this point only name merging is supported (not the full
attribute conflation). To this end any name that is unique will be kept in the
final output.

===== Provenance

Provenance can be provided in Hootenanny by specifying a uid (unique identifier
tag). This uid tag will be carried along with all input data and as multiple
features are conflated it will receive multiple uid values. For example,
conflating two features with `uid=1234` and `uid=4321` will result in a new
record with `uid=1234;4321`. It is recommended that the user use Universally
Unique Identifiers (<<UUID,UUID>>) for uid values, but any string is supported
as long as it is guaranteed to be unique and semi-colons are escaped as double
semi-colons as described on the <<OpenStreetMap,OpenStreetMap>> wiki. This
provenance information can be used to link the conflated output to the original
source data and possibly used to recreate the links that PLACES maintains.

==== Calling Hootenanny Conflation

The input data must contain at least the following tags:

* name - The name of the POI
* error:circular - A real number (double) representing the number of meters of error. Typically this is 1000 or 56000, but any number is acceptable.

A POI tag The simplest tag is `poi=yes`, but other more specific attributes are
defined in `conf/PoiSchema.json`.

You can use the typical translation mechanisms in Hootenanny to convert input
data into the OSM schema. An example translation file for geonames.org data can
be found in `translations/GeoNamesOrg.js`. Hootenanny does support reading
geonames.org data directly from a geonames .org text file by renaming the
extension to.geonames. For example:

------
wget http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/allCountries.zip
unzip allCountries.zip
mv allCountries.txt allCountries.geonames
hoot convert -D "convert.ops=SchemaTranslationVisitor" -D schema.translation.script=$HOOT_HOME/translations/GeoNamesOrg.js allCountries.geonames allCountries.osm.pbf
-------

==== Hootenanny Example Conflation Results

Below is an example using generated data over Colorado Springs, CO. There are a
total of 21 input features including four park POIs, five city/town center
points, and 12 Starbucks. The 12 Starbucks were chosen to show some limitations
in the conflation process. This data was created specifically to show how the
conflation occurs and is _not_ representative of real world data.

All the cities conflate as expected. There are some small naming deviations, but
all the data was generated such that the accuracy values would make them
conflate properly. The real problems are around Starbucks as discussed in the
_The Starbucks Problem_ below.

_The Starbucks Problem_

On the right hand side are a string of Starbucks coffee shops along Powers Blvd.
These are real world coffee shops that are spaced from about 150m apart at the
closest and 4km apart at the furthest. The topmost Starbucks in input 1 has a CE
of 100m, the southernmost coffee shop in input 2 has a CE of 150m and all others
have a CE of 1000m. The CE values were chosen to demonstrate conflation issues.
There are no intra-dataset duplicates.

If we allow self-conflation then there isn't enough information available to get
the correct answer. In the Southern portion there are six coffee shops all
within 1km of each other. However, given that the northern coffee shop is 4km
from the southernmost coffee shop those two points should never be conflated
together. Using the current mechanism it is possible to conflate those two
points together by chaining together matches. For example, the southernmost
coffee shop matches its northern neighbor, which matches its northern neighbor,
until you final reach the northernmost shop in < 1km hops. This results in a
single coffee shop as the output using Hootenanny.

The PLACES approach of first self-conflating each input and then performing the
challenge-conflation results in a slightly different problem. The
self-conflation of input 1 will result in a single point in the north with a CE
of 100m. The self-conflation of input 2 will result in a single point in the
south with a CE of 150m. Neither of these shops will be conflated together
during the challenge-conflation. This is a more desirable output, but a few
small changes to the data will create the single point problem as well.

_Possible Solution to the Starbucks Problem_

Currently there is no concept of a conflicting match. This allows very large
groups of matches to occur. If a conflict concept is introduced it allows two
matches to define either a conflicting or non-conflicting relationship. For
instance:

* Distance A -> B is 700m
* Distance B -> C is 700m
* Distance A -> C is 1300m

If our threshold is 1000m then A and C cannot match. Therefore match A->B and
B->C are conflicting matches. While the specifics are beyond the scope of this
document, this is very similar to concepts we would like to introduce to support
Li & Goodchild's conflation approach. Using this approach would avoid creating
very long chains of Starbucks by preventing high accuracy points from being
merged together and do so in a reasonable and deterministic way. This will also
prevent a very high CE point from conflating with a large number of low CE
points.
