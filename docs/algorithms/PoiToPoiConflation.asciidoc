=== POI Conflation

The PLACES algorithm formerly supported in Hootenanny was designed specifically
to handle GeoNames style data. In the case of GeoNames it is very fast, but
suffers from a few draw-backs.

* The dated base implementation we use does not consider POI type when matching
  features.
* The search radius of a feature is based primarily on the source data and not
  on the POI type. For example cities don't inherently get a larger search
  radius than hotels.
* No reviews are generated for users to evaluate. This is great if you want a
  fully automated system, but can lead to some hard to discover errors.

These issues become even more apparent when you try to apply the PLACES
conflation routines to data for which it was not intended. For example OSM
inputs tend to have very dense POI information that rely heavily on the type
tags and in some cases have no name tags at all.

The following sections describe the POI to POI conflation design, the test setup
and finally the test results.

[[PoiToPoiDesign]]
==== Design

This section covers the POI to POI design by going into details about
finding match candidates, labeling match candidates and merging matched
features.

The POI to POI conflation code uses the Hootenanny JavaScript
interface (See _JavaScript Overview_ in <<hootuser>> for details). The script contains
the business logic for conflating POIs. The code can be found and modified in the Hootenanny source
tree under `rules/Poi.js`.

The conflation flow is similar to the other conflation operations and happens in
a single pass of the data with other Unifying routines. The high level steps
are:

. Filter all element to only the POI types.
. Find match candidates based on the search radius of the POIs.
. Label the POI relationships based on an additives score.
. Merge POIs using the user specified tag merging routine.

The following sections will detail each of the steps above.

===== Filter Elements to Only POIs

Hootenanny takes a fairly liberal view on what should be considered a POI. This
overly optimistic approach may increase the number of unnecessary reviews but
helps to reduce errors.

To be considered a POI the following criteria must be met:

* The element must be a node. Lines and Polygons are not _Points_ of Interest.
* The node must either have a name, or be in a `poi` category as defined in
  Hootenanny's schema files.

The `poi` category is defined in Hootenanny's `conf/schema` directory. See the
_Schema Files_ section in <<hootuser>> for details. Any element that contains at
least one tag with the `poi` category is considered to be a POI type. If a tag
is not explicitly defined as being in the `poi` category it is assumed to be
outside the `poi` category.

Some examples of nodes that are considered to be a POI type are below:

* Highway rest areas and highway service stops
* All `amenity` tags such as hotels, restaurants, and concert halls.
* All `natural` tags such as cliff, beach and water.
* Some man made nodes such as electrical towers, power lines, and gantries.

Some examples of nodes that are not considered to be POIs are below:

* Stop signs, stop lights, speed bumps.
* Entrances to buildings.

===== Find Match Candidates

A match candidate is a pair of POIs that need to have a relationship assigned.
If a pair of POIs are not considered a match candidate then they will never be
marked as a match or review. Two POIs are a match candidate if the distance
between the two nodes is less than or equal to either of the search radii and
they come from two different inputs.

The search radius is determined in order of priority

1) by the 'search.radius.poi' configuration option (turned off by default)
2) by the elements circular error tag if the circular error is larger than the configured search
radius for the feature
3) by the aforementioned customizable search radii passed in as either a JSON string or file in 
the configuration option: `poi.search.radii`

Some example search radii are below:

* `historic` - 200m
* `place=city` - 5000m
* `place=village` - 3000m
* `amenity` - 200m

[[PoiToPoiSearchRadius]]
.Search Radius Example
image::images/SearchRadius.png[A simple example of overlapping search radii,scalewidth="50%"]

In <<PoiToPoiSearchRadius>> points A & B are points from the first input and
point C is from the second data set. For this reason A & B will never be match
candidates. A's search radius overlaps the point C so A & C are match
candidates. B and C have search radii that overlap, but B's search radius
doesn't overlap the node C, neither does C's search radius overlap the node B.
For this reason B & C are not match candidates.

===== Label Based on Additive Scores

Establishing a relationship between two points is a simple additive score.
Generally the score starts at zero and as evidence is found of a match the score
is increased. Strong evidence of a match increases the score by 1 and weak
evidence increases the score by 0.5. There are some exceptions that will be
covered at the end of this section.

Some examples of evidence include:

* Strong Evidence
 * POI types are similar (e.g. `amenity=bus_station` is similar to
   `transport=station`)
 * Additional attributes are similar (e.g. `cuisine`, `power`, `sport`, or
   `art_type`)
 * Very similar names
* Weak Evidence
 * Somewhat similar names
 * Points are close together (< = 20% of the search radii)

In some special cases the scores are manipulated based on type. For instance if
one or both of the nodes have no POI type attributes then the closeness and the
name are given double the weight when scoring. If one of the POIs is a `place`
and the other is not, then closeness and name are given half the weight. This
pragmatic approach helps to give better performance and reduce unnecessary
reviews at the expense of complexity. In the <<PoiToPoiPoiFutureWork, Future
Work>> section we will discuss approaches to reducing or eliminating these
exceptions.

Once the score has been established a simple threshold is used to establish the
relationship:

* If the score < = 0.5 the relationship is a miss.
* If the score is between 0.5 and 1.9 the relationship is a review.
* If the score is >= 1.9 the relationship is a match.

===== Comparing POI Types

Types are not always the same in the input data. One user may have an extraction
guide that specifies a point should have the type of its primary use (e.g.
`amenity=bus_station`), another input may not have a specific bus station tag
and it is simply tagged as a `transport=station`. Intuitively it is obvious that
these two points could represent the same entity, however that prior knowledge
must be exposed to Hootenanny.

To do this Hootenanny uses schema files. The schema files define that an
`amenity=bus_station` is similar to a `transport=station` with a graph. This
graph contains both `isA` and `similarTo` relationships. Details on how the
graph works can be found in <<CalculatingEnumeratedScore,Calculating the
Enumerated Score>>.

===== Example Scores

The table below lists a handful of examples as well as the associated scores and
relationships.

| place=village, name:en=Al Maks | name=Al Maks, amenity=pub | 0.5 Miss | very similar names, very close together, no place match

| name=Izbat Hawd an Nada, place=village | name=Izbat as Sab'in, place=populated | 0 Miss | None given by routine (Izbat is a common word so it is given a low weight when comparing names)
|======

===== Merging POIs

After relationships have been determined the system then determines how to apply
said relationships. The simplest cases are when a point is only involved in a
single relationship with no overlap between relationships. E.g. A matches only B
and B matches only A. In this case the two points will be merged as expected.

However, if there are overlapping matches Hootenanny makes no attempt to
determine which match is most appropriate, but marks all the overlapping matches
as needing to be reviewed by the user. This does increase the number of reviews
in some dense regions, but avoids some unnecessary errors in the process.

The first input is always used as the reference geometry.

The tags are merged using the default tag merging routine. Unless otherwise
specified the default tag merging routine is averaging.

==== Test Setup

To evaluate the performance of automatically conflated results manually matched
data is used. The manually matched data was translated into the OSM schema
before matching and all non-POI features were removed (e.g. buildings polygons
and roads). One data set is designated as the primary and the other as the
secondary. The primary data set gets a unique identifier applied to each feature
as a "REF1" tag. Then an analyst goes through all the features in the secondary
dataset and assigns tags to define the relationships to the corresponding
primary input features. The associated tags are listed below:

* REF2 - This tag signifies matches and can contain either the value of a single
  REF1 UID or `none`.
* REVIEW - If a feature in the secondary data set should be reviewed against
  zero or more features then this tag is used. A feature may need to be reviewed
  if there isn't enough information or the match is ambiguous. This tag will be
  populated with a semi-colon delimited list of REF1 UIDs.

The data sets used are varied in source and region, but for simplicity some data
sets are used multiple times.

All test results presented were run with Hootenanny v0.2.17-76-g140396e. An
iterative approach was used to improve performance against the data sets
provided. As the tests were run areas that caused errors were identified and
improved.

  rankdir = LR;
  node [shape=record,width=2,height=1,style=filled,fillcolor="#e7e7f3"];

  evaluate [label = "Evaluate\nResults"];
  "Manually\nMatch Data" ->

---------------------------------------------------------------------

In this test setup our testing data is used to improve the algorithm. This
creates a biased test scenario, but still provides useful information. When new
regions are evaluated in the future the test results are almost certain to vary
based on the POI types and data quality that is provided. In other words -- your
mileage will vary. There can be a great deal of variance in input data sets. To
get accuracy values over a new dataset a small test region should be evaluated
to obtain values specific to your data set.

==== Test Results

The test results are presented in the tables below. Note that the tables below
represent the categorization of relationships between POIs (not the number of
merged POIs). As such the number of POIs that do not match (miss) is very high
and omitted from the tables.

The number of reviews also seems quite high, but in reality reviewing a single
POI pair is relatively quick at about 12-20 seconds per review.

[[PoiToPoiPoiFutureWork]]
==== Future Work

In this section we discuss some areas of possible improvement.

In many cases Hoot relies very heavily on name comparisons for making matches.
Great promise was found by the PLACES team in using skip-grams for name
comparison. We would like to investigate using skip-grams to improve
performance (Note: skip-grams have been implemented, I believe, but not sure they've ever been
tested with POI to POI - BDW).

Also, Hootenanny uses a global dictionary of word frequencies to determine the relevance of a word
in a name. However, if you're looking at the word "Pennsylvania" in Pittsburgh the weight should be
low, but the same word in Indonesia would have a very high weight. We would like to investigate
using a weight that dynamically changes with the region (Note: There seems to be evidence this
has been done for POI to POI, but that needs to be verified - BDW).

In building and road matching we have had good success training supervised
models for matching data. We would like to explore using the same techniques for
matching POIs.

Generating POI training data can be a time consuming process. To increase
efficiency the user could be guided through the matching process with the UI.
This would dramatically speed up the process of creating training data, but
there is the possibility that false negatives (matches that Hootenanny misses)
will be dropped from the data.
