=== Script Conflation

Hootenanny supports "highway" conflation as defined by OpenStreetMap (OSM). In
OSM jargon a "highway" refers to paths, roads, cart tracks and possibly bridges
and tunnels. All these linear features are supported during conflation using
an existing statistical model tuned for highways.

However, in some cases it isn't desirable to use a predefined model to match and
merge linear features. For instance you may have one of the following data types
without any appropriate training data for the model:

* Rivers & Streams
* Walls
* Shorelines

The following sections discuss an approach to conflating lines in the general
case. This approach is currently being investigated and will likely generate
more discussion and refinement.

==== Background

Hootenanny currently supports generic conflation of data sets through the
JavaScript (<<JS,JS>>) Application Programmers Interface (API). See the
_JavaScript Conflation Reference_ <<hootuser>> for details. Using this interface
pairwise matching and merging is supported, as well as the merging of complex
linear situations such as partial matches, one to many matches, and many to many
matches.

}
---------------------------------------------------------------------

<<conflation-flow>> depicts the typical flow of data through a Hootenanny
conflation process. The steps are summarized below:

* Ingest & Clean - Read the files off of disk and perform any necessary cleaning
  operations (e.g. remove duplicate line strings).
* Estimate Pairwise Relationships - This process estimates whether or not two
  features represent the same entity. The exact approach is feature type
  dependent.
* Split Data Based on Subgraphs - If the conflation requires consistency (e.g.
  groups of buildings/POIs), then it goes into the graph based Matches,
  otherwise matches are sent to the optimize step.
* Optimize Set of Matches - Select the best set of consistent matches.
  Inconsistent or conflicting matches will be dropped.
* Create Graph Based Merges - Keep all subgraphs of matches. If they are
  inconsistent or conflicting then mark them all as needing review. Otherwise,
  merge them all together.
* Apply Merges - Given a set of matches, merge all the features into a single
  feature or set of features.
* Export - Export the data out to persistent storage.

The approach discussed below addresses customizations of three of the above
steps:

* Estimate Pairwise Relationships
* Split Data Based on Subgraphs
* Apply Merges

The following sections discuss these customizations in more detail.

===== Example Data Sets

[[coastlines]]
.Coastlines
image::images/Coastlines.png[Coastlines at two scales,scalewidth="50%"]

In <<coastlines>> is an example of two coastlines extracted at two different
scales. While there are obvious similarities there are also significant
differences. Especially with regard to the angular differences. Using a standard
road conflation routine with coastlines would likely produce sub-optimal
results, but conflating with a user derived set of rules could perform quite
well.

==== Approach

For the next phase of development we propose creating a new JavaScript API for
conflating linear data. This new approach will support some of the more complex
linear conflation situations such as one to many, many to many and partial
matches. In the following sections we will present an approach that provides the
mechanisms for defining the following functionality:

* Designate line candidate bounds
* Designate an element as a candidate for conflation
* Estimate subline relationships
* Determine line conflicts
* Merge lines

This generic approach to conflation rules will allow the user to define a number
of different conflation algorithms without getting into the details of the
geometry manipulations.

===== Designate Line Candidate Bounds

Before any match relationships are established a pair of lines or sublines must
be designated as a potential match. This is generally comparable to the maximum
distance provided in point matching, but rather than matching based solely on
minimum distance we look at the distance between point pairs along the string.

Hootenanny supports a fast subline matching routine (maximal nearest subline)
and a more exhaustive maximal subline algorithm. They each have trade-offs with
regards to performance versus computational complexity. These algorithms also
take parameters to determine the maximum distance allowable when calculating
matching sublines as well as the maximum difference in angle when calculating
sublines.

Hootenanny exposes the following parameters for determining subline match
bounds:

* Maximum distance (Provided as a multiple of the Circular Error)
* Maximum angular difference
* Maximal subline routine

===== Designate an Element as a Candidate for Conflation

For optimization purposes we don't want to evaluate all element pairs for
conflation if we know in advance that we can filter based on very coarse
criteria. For example, if we're conflating rivers then there is no need to look
at roads, power-lines or walls. Failing to implement this method will not likely
impact the final result, but will dramatically reduce performance.

The exposed method is named `isCandidate` and takes a single element as input.
If the element is a candidate for conflation the rest of the routines will be
evaluated. Otherwise, the element will be ignored for the purposes of this
specific line conflation routine.

Routines are exposed to JavaScript for determining if the element is a candidate
as needed. For example `isBuilding`, `isArea`, `isLinear`, etc.

See _Modifying Hootenanny with JavaScript_ <<hootuser>> for details.

===== Estimate Subline Relationships

Given a pair of line segments, assign a score to the relationship. This score is
in the form of 3 numbers that represent the probability of match, miss and
review (sums to one). For many expert systems this will simply return 1 for the
relationship that is most likely, but the closer values are to true
probabilities the better the optimization step will perform.

The relationship estimates are used by Hootenanny as described in the following
section to determine the best set of matches to merge or mark as needing review.

See _Modifying Hootenanny with JavaScript_ <<hootuser>> for the interface.

===== Merge Lines

Finally, the JavaScript routines must designate how the lines are to be merged.
This falls into two broad categories.

1. Optimize - The best (or near best) set of matches should be selected for
   merging.
2. Whole Group - The features being merged are treated as a whole group
   together. They should only be merged if the answer is unambiguous. If the
   answer is ambiguous or conflicting then flag the whole set of features as
   needing review.

The JavaScript code designates the conflation as either of the merge approaches
above. Using that information the Hootenanny core decides how to handle complex
match situations and creates a set of final matches that must be turned into
merge operations.

The JavaScript code defines how a merge operation is executed. At a minimum the
user must define how the following operations are performed:

1. Merge Tags - The JS code must either define a custom tag merging strategy or
   rely on the default Hootenanny tag merge operation.
2. Merge Geometries - The JS code must call one of the existing Hootenanny
   geometry merging techniques to merge the geometries.

A simple `snapWays` method is exposed to the user for snapping one way to
another. This is the most common linear use case. As the needs evolve more merge
methods will be exposed.

See also:

* `snapWays` in <<hootuser>>

==== Exposed Hootenanny APIs

As the effort evolves we will surely determine additional points to expose
appropriate functionality from Hootenanny code to the JS interface. At that
point some of the interfaces described below may become irrelevant and many more
will become necessary. Below are a number of examples to give an idea of the
interfaces that may be exposed.

* Calculate mean distance - Calculate the mean distance between two line strings.
* Calculate maximum angular difference - Calculate the maximum angular
  difference between two line strings.
* Snap line string - Snap one line string to another.
* Average line strings - Average two line strings together.

Example uses of these methods can be found in the hoot source code under
`rules/Line.js`.

==== Generic Line Conflation Test

The various test configuration are described in the sections below. All of these
tests compare a generic line conflation technique against the tuned Random
Forest Model. The generic technique is in the hoot distributable as
`rules/Line.js`.

NOTE: A compromise was struck on these tests between time spent and
thoroughness. These tests give a general impression of the performance
characteristics, but more time could be spent to provide better explanations and
more diverse scenarios. See <<GenericLineConflationFutureWork>> for details.

===== DC Tiger Perty

This test configuration uses Tiger data over the DC region to determine
performance. The `perturb --test` command is used with the following configuration:

-----
{
  "match.creators" : "ScriptMatchCreator,Line.js",
  "merger.creators" : "ScriptMergerCreator",
  "uuid.helper.repeatable": "true",
  "perty.test.num.runs": 1,
  "perty.test.num.simulations": 5
}
-----

During each test run the `perty.systematic.error.x` and
`perty.systematic.error.y` values are modified to vary the amount of error in
the tests.

===== Jakarta Easy Test

This test scenario uses two manually conflated data in a simple region of
Jakarta as a baseline for evaluation. The methods described in the
<<Evaluation,Evaluation>> section are used for comparison. A higher value means
closer agreement with the manually conflated data.

===== Jakarta Spaghetti Test

Similar to above, this test scenario uses two manually conflated data sets, but
in a more complex interchange region of Jakarta. The methods described in the
<<Evaluation,Evaluation>> section are used for comparison. A higher value means
closer agreement with the manually conflated data. Maintaining proper network
topology is much more complicated in this scenario due to multiple overpasses,
one way streets and tunnels.

===== Manually Matched

This data set contains test data over the regions described in _Classify the
Match_ section. This is likely the most comprehensive of the tests for match
results as it uses data over several regions extracted using several different
methods. However, this test does very little for evaluating how well features
are merged.

In <<GenericConflationQuality>> 90% confidence interval error bars are presented
when relevant.  For some tests no confidence intervals are generated and have
been omitted (e.g. raster comparison and calculating the number of correct
matches). In the case of DC Perty 20m the error bars are omitted due to a
known limitation.

You can see that the scores are generally comparable. The more complex spaghetti
example has slightly higher scores. The manually matched data has dramatically
higher scores for the trained model versus the generic rules. The exact reason
for this requires more investigation.

The image above shows the conflation speed for some of the test runs discussed
above. The Perty test runs include the entire perty operation (perturbing,
conflating and scoring the data). Re-running those experiments without the
testing times included will likely reduce the overall runtime, but the times
will likely still be very similar as most of the compute time was spent
conflating. The Easy and Spaghetti tests show a much more dramatic difference in
time demonstrating that the runtime difference will be data set specific.
Further work is required if we want to quantify when to expect those
differences.

[[GenericLineConflationFutureWork]]
==== Future Work

To investigate this approach and it's performance on known data we will likely
follow the steps listed below. These steps may change with
changing requirements or new knowledge of the problem set and use cases.

1. Identify additional candidates for generic line conflation such as walls or
   railways.
2. Implement routines that give reasonable results based on subjective review.
3. Apply the generic line conflation routines to road training/testing data to
   observe quantitative results.
4. Report findings.

Some areas where the generic line tests above can be improved:

1. Re-run all tests with a single version of the software
2. Address the known Perty limitation bug and re-run the Perty 20m test.
3. Investigate the discrepancy in the manually conflated data sets
4. Extend to include other data types
