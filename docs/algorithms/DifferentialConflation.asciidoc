== Differential Conflation

Differential Conflation makes use of the Unifying conflation framework within Hootenanny,
but attempts a much simpler operation than "full" conflation. The idea is to allow a user to
take two datasets, A and B, and generate a changeset from them such that the changeset
includes all of the data in set B that does not overlap (conflict, need merging, etc.) with
set A. The changeset can then be applied directly to dataset A.



This algorithm is still under development.
