=== Cookie Cutter

The _Cookie Cutter_ is a method of clipping a region out of a map before
conflation. See `--cookie-cut` in <<hootuser>> for more details. When one
data set is far superior to another this can improve the conflation quality and
reduce amount of time reviewing.

Hootenanny uses the
link:$$https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny/wiki/files/2010-B-01-AlphaShapes.pdf$$[alpha
shape] algorithm to define the shape of a finite set of points. In this case we
treat the vertexes of the input shapefile as the set of points when calculating
the alpha shape.

By tuning the _alpha_ value the alpha shape can be made to generalize the set of
points, or tightly fit the points. If a large enough alpha value is specified
then the shape will be a convex hull.

==== Automatically Selecting an Alpha Value

In <<bernardini99>> (Section 6.2) they discuss an approach of performing a
binary search across possible alpha values to determine an alpha value that
meets the following criteria:

* All points are connected
* All the points are on a boundary or in an interior
* Its boundary is a two-manifold (3D object) -- In our case we're just looking
  for a single legit polygon -- no lines.

mention calculating the alpha value
such that a specified number of components are returned. In this case it may be
desirable to return two or more polygons if we know that there is significant
distance between two mapped areas such as cities.

===== Efficiently Selecting an Alpha Value

The approach described in <<bernardini99>> is fairly computationally inefficient
in that each time an alpha value is evaluated the alpha shape must be
recalculated and every point evaluated for meeting the criteria.

First a couple of definitions:

* connected - We call two points connected if the distance between them is less
  than alpha value and there is an edge resulting from the Delaunay
  Triangulation.
* connected triangle - Three points are all connected in a triangle.

Rather than implementing that full <<bernardini99>> mechanism, another possible
approach is to evaluate each point incrementally as you increase the alpha value
and stop when you have reached an alpha value that satisfies the following
criteria:

1. Every point is part of a connected triangle
2. The combined points create the specified number of components or less
   (similar to CGAL)

The first criterion is equivalent to being on a boundary or interior. I'm sure a
math PhD could spend the afternoon proving this, but for now we're going on an
informal rational & intuition. If the point is on a connected triangle it must
be part of either an interior or boundary. The logic going:

The point can be in one of four states:

1. On a boundary - To be on a boundary the point must be adjacent to areas
   outside the polygon and inside the polygon. If it is part of a connected
   triangle and part of a disconnected triangle then the point is on a boundary.
2. Isolated - If the point is not connected to any other point.
3. Connected via a line - The point is connected to one or more other points,
   but the points do not form a triangle.
4. An interior point - A point is only part of connected triangles.

Given those definitions, if the point is part of at least one connected triangle
it is either an interior point or a boundary point. We should be able to
determine this by traversing the graph produced by the Delaunay Triangulation.

Now that we have that out of the way, we need to determine how many components
make up the alpha shape. This can be determined via a Disjoint Set. Rather than
describe the idea, I'll describe the implementation:

. Order all the edges in the Delaunay Triangulation by length ascending. This is
  the list of alpha values that need to be evaluated.
. Initialize the disjoint set with one value per point
. While there are still edges
.. Pop an edge
.. Set our current alpha value to the edge length
.. If the two points connected by the edge are now part of a connected triangle,
... Join the two points into a single component use the disjoint set.
... If we're now down to the desired number of components, stop
