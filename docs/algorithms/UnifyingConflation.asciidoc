=== Unifying Conflation

There have been two conflation designs built into Hootenanny over the course of its development for all feature types and three for road features. The original design, from the initial software design stage (circa 2012) uses a custom approach built upon a greedy optimization method.
However, this legacy approach only dealt with roads and did not flag questionable situations as reviews.  This approach is no longer available.

Unifying conflation is the newer conflation approach for all feature types initially developed under
subsequent efforts with the following design goals:

* Process the <<RoadConflation,road>>, <<BuildingConflation,building>> and
  <<PoiToPoiAlgs,POI>> conflation routines in a single process flow.
* Take advantage of the optimization methods presented in <<li2011>>.
* Flag reviewable items for the user.

In <<unifying-conflation-flow>> the high level conflation data flow is
presented. Each of these steps will be discussed in more detail in the following
sections.

A third conflation type for road exists, named Network Conflation, described later in this document.

[[IngestAndClean]]
==== Ingest & Clean

This part of the data flow is consistent with the legacy road conflation
approach. For details on the cleaning operations please see <<hootuser>>.

[[EstimatePairwiseRelationships]]
==== Estimate Pairwise Relationships

The relationship between all features in a data set are estimated in a pairwise
fashion during this stage. Because calculating all the relationships explicitly
would be computationally impractical many of the relationships are eliminated
implicitly based on simple rules such as feature type or distance thresholds.
Relationships are represented as one of three states:

* Match - The two features represent the same entity.
* Miss - The two features do not represent the same entity.
* Review - The relationship between the two features is uncertain.

The relationship between two entities is internally calculated as a probability
of each state (value [0, 1], where the sum of the probabilities equals 1). A
tunable MatchThreshold is exposed that determines the relationship when a
concrete decision must be made. The match threshold contains a threshold for
each of the Match, Miss and Review and uses the following logic to determine the
relationship:

------
if P(review) >= review threshold:
  return "Review"
if P(match) >= match threshold && P(miss) >= miss threshold:
  return "Review"
if P(match) >= match threshold:
  return "Match"
if P(miss) >= miss threshold:
  return "Miss"
else:
  return "Review"
------

Each match type may have it's own logic for discovering relationships. For
instance, when discovering building relationships queries are made to determine
all buildings that fall within the specified threshold using the map's R-Tree
index. The matches are then evaluated and any "Match" or "Review" relationships
are stored for processing in later stages.

Conversely, the POI match types create a custom <<fq-tree,FQ-Tree/R-Tree Hybrid
Index>> for querying out similar matches. This custom index is then utilized to
find candidate matches and the resulting "Match" and "Review" relationships are
stored for later processing.

NOTE: The `conflate.*.threshold` configuration options are not applied
consistently across map types and require refinement so they can be set on an
type by type basis. This is a known issue.

==== Split Data Based on Sub-graphs

During conflation matches are processed using either an aggressive or
conservative approach to selecting the best set of matches. Before a best set of
matches can be determined, conflicting matches must be flagged. A match conflict
is defined as two matches that cannot be applied as merges to a map
simultaneously.

Each match type defines exactly how a conflict is defined for that data type.
For instance, roads are considered conflicting if applying one match as a merge
prevents the second match from being applied as a merge. POIs are considered a
conflict if any of the POIs in the group contains a Miss relationship. E.g. A
matches B, B matches C, but A misses C.

.Simple Example of Conflicting and Non-Conflicting Lines

The aggressive approach, inspired by <<li2011>>, selects a set of
non-conflicting matches that maximizes the score of all the non-conflicting
matches. The score of the match is match type specific, but generally is just
the P(match).

The conservative approach keeps all <<ConnectedComponent,connected components>>
of matches that are non-conflicting as matches and marks all connected
components that contain conflicts as needing review.

Each match type defines the appropriate way of selecting matches. For building
to building, building to POI and POI to POI matches the conservative connected
component approach is utilized. Due to the amount of overlap between matches
with roads the more aggressive approach must be used.

==== Optimize

The data selected for the more aggressive optimization goes through the
following steps:

. Determine the set of conflicts within the matches
. Use linear programming to determine a good set of matches.
. Use greedy search to determine a good set of matches.
. Select the best result from the methods above.

Using a linear programming approach to determining the best set of matches can
be extremely expensive (for large data sets it can take 95% or more of the total
conflation time). However, anecdotal results show that the increased compute
time sometimes yields only minor improvements in the conflated result. To ensure
a balance between compute time and conflation quality is achieved, a
configuration option is exposed to the user to select the amount of time spent
optimizing. Even if no solution is found in the specified time limit the greedy
search is guaranteed to find a solution and runs very quickly in comparison.

The best set of matches found is carried through the process and the remaining
conflicting matches are discarded.

==== Apply Merges

While there may have been some clean operations that modified the map, up
until this point there have been no changes made to the map during conflation.

After the optimization is complete a selection of identified matches is ready to
be applied as merges. Any matches that overlap (e.g. two POIs that match a
single building) are combined into a single merge operation. Each merge
operation is applied in turn to create the final conflated map.

During this process the status of features that are conflated is changed from
either _Unknown1_ or _Unknown2_ (representing the source data set) to
_Conflated_. Features marked for review maintain the _Unknown*_ status.

===== Orphaned Matches

In some cases it is too computationally expensive to determine that a conflict
exists. To account for this the detection of the conflict may be delayed until
the merge is applied. In these cases, a merge may realize the conflict while merging
and mark the feature as needing review. In some cases this can create a single
output record that doesn't appear to have any neighboring features that require
reviewing.

This is an open problem that require more investigation.

==== Export

After conflation the data is ready for export. The data goes through the typical
Hootenanny save process to store the output data.
