== Attribute Conflation

Attribute Conflation allows for transferring only tags from one dataset to another dataset whose geometries are changed as little as possible.  
This conflation workflow can be used when you nearly absolute confidence in your input reference dataset geometry, its tags are lacking detail,
and your secondary dataset has good tag attribution.  Attribute Conflation is still experimental as has primarily been tested against road data
up to this point.

=== One Way Streets

Attribute Conflation strives to preserve the correct one way direction for one way streets.  This can be difficult if the reference
data is poorly attributed regarding one way streets and incorrect one way direction tag transfers may sometimes occur.

=== Road Type Conflicts

If roads between the two input datasets have conflicting type tags, other then the generic highway=road tag, Hootenanny Attribute Conflation will
not conflate the road pair together, so as not to lose road type accuracy.

=== Bridges

If the secondary layer being conflated has bridges connecting two road segments together and the reference data does not have those bridges,
Attribute Conflation will need to make geometry change to the reference data to properly conflate the bridges.  If you wish to make
no geometry changes to your reference dataset under any circumstance, you can disable the configuration option, 
+attribute.conflation.allow.ref.geometry.changes.for.bridges+.

=== Aggressive Road Joining

Another option for Attribute Conflation, disabled by default, is to enable aggressive road joining.  Generally, with this option disabled 
you will end up with fewer road type and name tag transfers from the secondary layer to the reference layer for some road segements but at the cost of potentially more empty road segments in the output.  
Generally, with the option enabled you will end up with more road type and name tag transfers from the secondary layer to the reference 
layer for some road segements but at the cost of some incorrect tag transfers.  To use this feature, enable the configuration option 
+attribute.conflation.aggressive.highway.joining+.

=== Buildings

As of 3/5/19, Attribute Conflation handles conflating buildings slightly differently than other conflation types.  The default building 
conflation behavior in Hootenanny generates both a building and multipolygon relation for each merged building, with the multipolygon relation
added as a member of the building relation.  Attribute Conflation generates only the multipolygon relation for merged buildings.

=== Reviews

Attribute Conflation also allows for manual review of features that Hootenanny was unable to conflate and flagged for review.  However, this
option is disabled by default.  To use this feature, enable the +attribute.conflation.allow.reviews.by.score+ configuration option.  You also
have the ability to threshold reviews by review score, in a range of 0.0 to 1.0 (1.0 being the strongest case for feature pair to be reviewed), 
in order to reduce the number of reviews you are presented with.  See the configuration options +review.score.criterion.min.threshold+ and 
+review.score.criterion.max.threshold+.  Hootenanny will often return reviews with a score of 1.0 when it has no idea how to conflate a particular
pair of features or those feature exhibit some unusual properties.  Therefore counterintuitively, setting a maximum threshold below 1.0 may
reduce the number of reviews you see even further in the conflated output.
