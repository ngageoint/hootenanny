=== Feature Reviews

During the conflation process if Hootenanny cannot determine with confidence the best way to
conflate features, it will mark one or more features as needing a manual review by the user. The
follow describes possible review scenarios. Keep the review messages alphabetized within each table.

.*Linear Feature Reviews*
[width="100%"]
|======
| *Needs Review Message* | *Possible Causes* | *Potential User Actions to Take*
| Elements contain too many ways and the computational complexity is unreasonable. | A multiline string geometry was attempted to be conflated that had more lines in it than Hootenanny can conflate in a reasonable amount of time using its current algorithms. Currently, that is when both input sublines to conflate contain more than four lines, or if the sum of lines they contain is greater than seven. | Review this feature manually. It can only be automatically conflated by developing new conflation algorithms that can handle multilinestring input data of this size.
| Internal Error: Expected a matching subline, but got an empty match. Please report this to the developers. | An unexpected internal error occurred. Multiple matching line parts have caused extra difficulty during the line matching process. | Review this feature manually, and report this behavior to the Hootenanny development team for further examination.
| Missing way node(s)... | Generated by `ReportMissingElementsVisitor` to mark child elements which are referenced but missing from input. | Generally used as a debugging tool only and disabled by default.
| MultiLineString relations can only contain ways when matching sublines. | A input being conflated of geometry type multiline string contained an OSM feature type other than a way (nodes or relations). | Review this feature manually. This is invalid input data for Hootenanny conflation purposes and cannot be conflated automatically.
| Multiple overlapping way matches were found within one set of ways. | When attempting to conflate sublines from line inputs, multiple overlapping lines were found. | Review this feature manually, as it is too complex for Hootenanny to currently handle.
| No valid matching subline found. | When conflating two linear inputs, Hootenanny could not find a corresponding matching subline part in one of the inputs. | Review this feature manually, as Hootenanny can not determine automatically whether it matches any feature in the opposite input dataset.
| "Potentially snappable unconnected way" | This occurs when the `UnconnectedWaySnapper` is configured to review snappable ways rather than snap them. | Generally used as a debugging tool only and disabled by default. Set `snap.unconnected.ways.review.snapped.ways=false` to disable.

.*Road Specific Reviews*
[width="100%"]
|======
| *Needs Review Message* | *Possible Causes* | *Potential User Actions to Take*
| A complex road situation was found with multiple plausible solutions. | This is specific to the Network Roads Algorithm and occurs when a single road is involved multiple matches. | Each review should be resolved manually.
| Ambiguous intersection match. Possible dogleg? Very short segment? Please verify merge and fix as needed. | This is specific to the Network Roads Algorithm and occurs when a partial match cannot be merged. | Each review should be resolved manually. 
| Internal Error: Overlapping partial matches were found . To resolve please make the logical conflation operations manually. | This is specific to the Network Roads Algorithm and occurs when a partial match cannot be merged. | Each review should be resolved manually. 
| "One or more ways in the merge are being removed. This is likely due to an inconsistent match. Please review the length of the review for overly aggressive merges and manually merge features using input data/imagery. There may also be one or more zero length ways at intersections." | This is specific to the Network Roads Algorithm and is caused by ?. | Each review should be resolved manually. 
| Road crossing polygon... | This occurs when a road is found crossing a polygon after conflation. | Determine if the road is allows to cross the polygon and adjust it if not. The rules for roads allowed to cross polygons is controlled in `conf/core/RoadCrossingPolyRules.json`.

.*Building Specific Review Situations*
[width="100%"]
|======
| *Needs Review Message* | *Possible Causes* | *Potential User Actions to Take*
| Identified as changed with an IoU score of <score>, which is less than the specified threshold of <score>. | If Intersection Over Union scoring is enabled during building conflation (not integrated at the time of this writing), this is generated if the IoU score passes the configured threshold. | Review the buildings to decide if the change between the two warrants merging them together.
| Merging multiple buildings from each data source is error prone and requires a human eye. | This occurs if a building is involved in a many to many match. | Each review should be resolved manually or set `building.merge.many.to.many.matches=true` to avoid it.
|======

.*POI/Polygon Specific Reviews*
[width="100%"]
|======
| *Needs Review Message* | *Possible Causes* | *Potential User Actions to Take*
| Conflicting information: multiple features have been matched to the same feature and require review." | This occurs if a POI or polygon feature is involved in more than one POI/Polygon Conflation match. | Each review should be resolved manually or set `poi.polygon.auto.merge.many.poi.to.one.poly.matches=true` to avoid it (TODO: verify this). 
| Inter-matcher overlapping matches | This occurs when a POI/Polygon Conflation match conflicts with a POI/POI Conflation match. | Each review should be resolved manually. 
|======

.*Railway Specific Review Situations*
[width="100%"]
|======
| *Needs Review Message* | *Possible Causes* | *Potential User Actions to Take*
| "Crossing railways" | This occurs during Railway Conflation if two linear railway features that were not crossing each other before conflation are crossing each other after conflation. | Decide if the railway features should cross each other. If not, update them manually to not cross each other. 
|======

.*Script Conflate Specific Reviews*
[width="100%"]
|======
| *Needs Review Message* | *Possible Causes* | *Potential User Actions to Take*
| Overlapping matches | This occurs if a feature is involved in more than one script conflation match. | Each review should be resolved manually.
