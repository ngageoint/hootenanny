Changes to custom conflation routine config files here must be made when corresponding changes are made to the core configuration files to support the Cucumber V1 tests. e.g. If a change is made to core/AttributeConflation.conf, that change must be made to conflationAttributeOps.json within this file.

The same is not true for the Cucumber V2 tests, as the services will pass the core configuration file as part of the conflate command call. e.g. core/AttributeConflation.conf will be passed to the conflate command by the services when Attribute Conflation is selected within the UI. Changes to core config files to allow modifications from the UI may optionally be exposed in conflationTypes.json for V2.
