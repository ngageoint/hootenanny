# The format is: <street text>\t<street text abbreviation>.  List one token per line in alphabetical order.

# TODO: We could probably expand this to use something like: https://pe.usps.com/text/pub28/28apc_002.htm ... there's a lot of stuff in there,
# so using all of it could have an adverse affect in parts of the code.
