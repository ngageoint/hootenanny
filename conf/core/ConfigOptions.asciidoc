//
// The ConfigOptions.asciidoc is a specially formatted file that is parsed
// during the build process to generate the ConfigOptions.h header file and
// user documentation. Changing the default values in this file will change
// the way Hootenanny runs so be careful, this isn't just documentation.
//
// This file is also parsed by asciidoc to generate the user documentation. Look
// at that; our docs and code are in lock step! Nice. Please keep this in mind
// when writing documentation. This isn't just comments, this is user
// documentation. Try to include the following information in the description:
//
// * What does this configuration change?
// * If relevant, what are the units of the config option (e.g. meters)?
// * Where can the user go to get more information? Please reference the
//   appropriate document. E.g. "See `ogr2osm` in the _Command Line
//   Reference_ for more information."
// * What other options may be of interest? E.g. "See also
//   `big.perty.op.sigma`"
// * Please keep the list in Alphabetical order.
//
// The format is as follows:
//
// The section name is all lowercase and separated by periods. This shouldn't
// contain any special characters.
// === key.name
//
// * Data Type: <string, double, list, bool>
// * Default Value: <value>
//
// If the default value is for a list then the default value should be followed
// by a number of sub items in the list. E.g.
// * Default Value:
// ** `<Value 1>`
// ** `<Value 2>`
// The left ticks provide proper formatting in the documentation.
//
// Finally the section that contains the documentation. This is free-form
// asciidoc just make sure you don't start any lines with "=== ".
// http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/
//

setting can have a negative impact on performance if set to a very low value.

=== apidb.bulk.inserter.output.files.copy.location

* Data Type: string
* Default Value: ``

Use this option if you wish to retain the file data generated during an OSM/Hootenanny API database
write.  This option is not needed and will be ignored if writing OSM data to a SQL file that will be

* Data Type: long
* Default Value: `1`

First record ID to assign to written relations when writing to an OSM/Hootenanny API database or
SQL file.  Must be a positive number.  Use this when working with an offline database and know the

duplicated element IDs, check for invalid way node references, and check for invalid relation member
references.  Only duplicate element IDs and invalid way node references will cause a failure.
Invalid relation members will cause a warning to be logged.  You should enable this setting if you
are loading data that has not been previously validated in another OSM API database.  Enabling this
setting may cause writing to an OSM API database to occur more slowly.

If set to true, the Hootenanny API database writer will insert new records using Postgres COPY
statements, which may increase performance when writing large datasets.  This setting can only
be activated when writing new records and will not work when existing records need to be modified
or deleted.  It also requires writing out temporary files, so extra disk space is needed.

=== hootapi.db.writer.output.id.mappings

* Data Type: string

IDs as they're created. The `DefaultIdGenerator` assigns IDs in a decrementing fashion (e.g. -1,
-2, ...). The `hoot::PositiveIdGenerator` increments the IDs (e.g. 1, 2, 3, ...).

Both generators maintain a different count for each element type. E.g. you can have a Node with ID
1 and a Way with ID 1. This will not cause any problems within Hootenanny and is a legitimate way
of assigning IDs within OSM.

Example Usage:

----
hoot ogr2osm -D id.generator=hoot::PositiveIdGenerator -D id.generator.node.start=100 -D id.generator.relation.start=200 -D id.generator.way.start=300 $HOOT_HOME/translations/Identity.js myoutput.osm myinput.osm

other tags from elements.

=== levenshtein.distance.alpha

* Data Type: double
* Default Value: `1.15`

Raise the Levenshtein score to this power before returning this result. If alpha is greater than
1 then this makes low scores even lower. Valid values are > 0.

The default alpha value of 1.15 was determined through experimentation with a Jakarta data set
using MeanWordSetDistance as the container classes. See Redmine ticket #2349 for some experiment
details.  The "best" value varies depending on the input data as well as how the data is being used.

=== log.format

* Data Type: string
* Default Value: `%d{HH:mm:ss.SSS} %-5p ...%.30F(%4L) %m%n`

** `hoot::SuperfluousWayRemover` - Remove all ways that contain no nodes or all the nodes are exactly the same.
** `hoot::IntersectionSplitter` - Split all highway type ways that intersect.
** `hoot::UnlikelyIntersectionRemover` - Remove implied intersections that are likely incorrect. For example, a motorway overpass intersecting a residential street at a 90° is considered unlikely and "unsnapped". The geometry location is not modified.
** `hoot::DualWaySplitter` - Split highway types that are marked as divided into two separate geometries marked as oneway roads. A number of assumptions must be made to do this including assumptions about the direction of travel on roads (right or left hand drivers).
** `hoot::ImpliedDividedMarker` - If two roads implicitly should be marked as divided based on the surrounding roads, mark it as such. This is primarily caused by the FACC+ spec which does not allow bridges to be marked as divided.
** `hoot::DuplicateNameRemover` - Remove any duplicate names. See `duplicate.name.case.sensitive` for modifying the case sensitivity.
** `hoot::SmallWayMerger` - Merge any ludicrously small ways that have essentially the same attributes. Things like `UUID` are ignored. See `small.way.merger.threshold` for setting the threshold value.
** `hoot::RemoveEmptyAreasVisitor` - Remove all area elements that have a area of zero.
** `hoot::RemoveDuplicateAreaVisitor` - Remove any area elements that are essentially the same.
** `hoot::NoInformationElementRemover` - Remove any elements that don't have any tags with information. (E.g. only contains UUID and source, but not FCODE equivalent or other informative tags).

environments, the risk of record ID conflicts will be present in the database.  The output
destination must be an OSM API database or this setting will always be treated as being "false".
If the output destination is a SQL file, the SQL statements to update the record IDs will be
written to the SQL output for later execution.

larger than this value will cause the test run's status to be described as failing.  If you are
not sure what your expected scores should be and want to bypass this check, create a list with
all entries equal to "1.0" of the same size as perty.test.num.runs, and then

to "1.0" of the same size as perty.test.num.runs, and then set perty.test.allowed.score.variance
to "1.0".  This effectively disables the score validation.

=== perty.test.fail.on.better.score

* Data Type: bool
* Default Value: `false`

If true, the `perty-test` will mark a test as failing if its test run score is higher than the
expected score and outside of the allowable score variance; if false, will always allow higher

* Data Type: bool
* Default Value: `false`

Always force the orthographic projection when determining a proper planar projection. In typical
usage this will never be used (the automatically selected projection should always be at least as
good). This is most useful if you want to get consistent results even if the list of potential
projections change over time. Very handy in unit tests.

=== token.keep.non.words

Hootenanny will only use Greedy Constrained Matches.

=== unify.optimizer.time.limit

* Data Type: double
* Default Value: `60`

The maximum amount of time in seconds to wait for the optimizer to complete. A value of -1 makes
the wait time limit unlimited.

If this value is set to something other than -1 your conflation results may change between multiple
runs. Especially if the machine Hoot is running on is under heavy load. If the "CM Score:" value
is changing between runs and GLPK isn't finding an optimal solution then this is likely causing
different output.  Just because the output is changing doesn't mean it is wrong, but this can be
problematic if you're doing testing or expecting repeatable output for other.

generally only done in debugging environments.  This setting allows for partitioning the level of
detail in the review relation tags into two groups.  Turning this setting off can be useful during
debugging in situations where you are comparing map outputs and want to see reviews in the output
but are not concerned with a higher level of review detail.  Disabling this setting will also
disable AddHilbertReviewSortOrderOp, the output of which is depended upon by the Hootenanny user
interface.
