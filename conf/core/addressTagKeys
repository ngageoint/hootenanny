# A list of tag keys, grouped by type, that describe feature addresses components.  

# All entries are based off of data in TagInfo (https://taginfo.openstreetmap.org) or direct experience with other data.  Since conflation 
# only attempts to match features in roughly close geographic proximity, we don't care about higher level address components like city, 
# state, country, etc.
#
# The format is: <address component type>=<tag key 1>,<tag key 2>... Keep address component types and tag keys in alphabetical order.
