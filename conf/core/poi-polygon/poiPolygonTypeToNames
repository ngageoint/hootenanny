# This list maps common name texts that represent different types of features to specific OSM types.  
#
# This allows for more granularity when comparing elements with the same OSM type.  This is different than what is contained in the 
# Hootenanny schema files, as this deals with name text and not just feature types.  Possibly, a more robust framework could eventually be 
# created for this capability if its proven more widely useful (more than just POI/Polygon conflation).
#
# example 1; two features with tags: 1) name=Bristow High School, amenity=school, 2) name=Bristow Elementary School, amenity=school.  These 
# two have matching types, and depending upon how name matching is configured, you could end up with a match/review between these two features 
# when you should (most of the time) end up with a miss.
#
# example 2; two features with tags: 1) name=Bristow High School, amenity=school, 2) name=Bristow College, amenity=school.  In this case the
# college was mistakenly tagged as amenity=school, when it should have been tagged as amenity=university.  These two should not match either.
#
# Format: <OSM tag>;<name text 1>,<name text 2>,... List one entry per line in alphabetical order by tag.  Keep subtypes in alphabetical order
# and in lower case.  Each name text should correspond to text commonly associated with a unique subtype of the OSM type.
