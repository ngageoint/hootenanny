  Scenario: I can conflate using the attribute conflation type
    Given I am on Hootenanny

    And I press "Add Reference Dataset"
    And I click the "ToyTestBCucumber" Dataset
    And I press "Add Layer"
    Then I wait 30 "seconds" to see "span.strong" element with text "ToyTestBCucumber"
    And I press "Add Secondary Dataset"
    And I click the "ToyTestACucumber" Dataset
    And I press "Add Layer"

    Then I should see "Conflate"
    And I press "Conflate"
