# to do your own similar workflow is the changeset derivation itself...ends up looking something like:

# falling completely within the bounds would require some significant work to the ApiDbReader bounds query. Bounds reading by the OsmXmlReader,

# DATA PREP

# First distort one layer with perturbation and loads it into an OSM API DB as ref data. Perturbation was done only b/c I couldn't find readily
# available two similar but not identical test building datasets. The perturbed features are uglier, so the idea is we'd want to get them
# replaced by something better (what we have in the original, unperturbed data). 
#
# Preserving the source data IDs (reader.use.data.source.ids=true in the second convert step) is important here for changeset derivation since 
# we're loading ref data that we don't own (like MapEdit) and need to stay in sync with. 

# The reason we're loading the perturbed data into a file before loading it into the osm apidb, vs peturbing it straight to the osm api db is
# that the test data has negative IDs and we want to simulate a realistic scenario with postive IDs in the ref (hence, 
# hoot::PositiveIdGenerator).

# Next, read the original unperturbed data from a file into a Hoot API DB as secondary data. The unperturbed features looks good, so we'll want 
# to keep them). 

# Since the perturbed data (ref) was derived directly from this secondary layer, there will overlapping element IDs. Changeset 
# derivation with cookie cutting (or any map consuming op) cannot work when there are overlapping element IDs in the two input datasets...we 
# simply can't support that scenario. TODO: This does get a little confusing as I think we should be able to use either 
# reader.use.data.source.ids equal to true or false here (with false making more sense), however errors are occurring when its set to false, 
# so leaving it at true for now. We do, however, want positive IDs put into the hoot api db since negative IDs in the db make no sense.

# CHANGESET DERIVATION

# Test changeset derivation both from an osm file and from a hoot api db layer. 

# This changeset derivation has cookie cutting applied to it which cuts a subset AOI out of ref data and puts the secondary data into 
# that location. Then, it derives a changeset that is the difference between the unmodified ref data and the data with the section of 
# new data added to it. The resultant changeset should have deleted all ref data within the AOI and added all the secondary data within it.
