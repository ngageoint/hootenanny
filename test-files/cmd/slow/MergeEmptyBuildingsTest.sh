# This tests the fix applied by #2034 by merely checking that no crash occurs due to the empty buildings that get 
# passed into the building merger.  The bug is only reproduced when Unifying conflation is used and all other 
# matchers are activated (matchers circa Jan. 2018).
# Finishing #2058 may require this test needing modification or may make it obsolete.
