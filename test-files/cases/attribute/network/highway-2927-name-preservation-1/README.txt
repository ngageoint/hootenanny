This is an Attribute Conflation test for retaining original name tags.

The secondary roads named Bulevar Panteón should not lose its original name when being joined/merged with other ways.  Previously,
"Bulevar Panteón" was being pushed to alt_name and one of the other names was promoted to "name".

Note that there is a bug where the Southern portion of Bulevar Panteón overwrites the road named Av. Sur.
