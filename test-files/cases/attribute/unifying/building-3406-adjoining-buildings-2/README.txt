This is an Attribute Conflation test to ensure many to one building matches with adjoining buildings merge correctly. The buildings from both
input should match with the output having a building relation made up of two buildings representing the geometries from the first input with 
and having tags from the single second input building (TODO: #3451 will change the output from a building relation to a multipoly relation).
