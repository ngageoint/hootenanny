This is an Attribute Conflation test for ensuring that building height tags are preserved on building parts.

The input consists of a set of reference buildings, each with height tags, and a single secondary building with no height tag. The output 
should contain a multipolygon relation consisting of the reference geometries and preserving the individual height tags on each individual 
building part making up the relation.
