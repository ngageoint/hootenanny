This is an Attribute Conflation test to ensure that building pairs where one member of the pair is completely contained by the other are always
matched and not reviewed. The configuration option, building.force.contained.match, makes this possible. The tags of the secondary building, 
"Building 1", should be merged into all three buildings in the reference layer. All three buildings should become part of the same mutipolygon 
relation.
