This is an Attribute Conflation test with the Unifying Roads Algorithm for retaining original name tags.

The secondary roads named Bulevar Panteón should not lose its original name when being joined/merged with other ways.  Previously,
"Bulevar Panteón" was being pushed to alt_name and one of the other names was promoted to "name".

Note that there is a bug where the Southern portion of Bulevar Panteón overwrites the road named Av. Sur.
