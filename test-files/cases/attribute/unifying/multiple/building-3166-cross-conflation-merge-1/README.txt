This is an Attribute Conflation test to ensure that any buildings involved in multiple matches with both Building Conflation and POI to 
Polygon Conflation are merged instead of reviewed (default hoot behavior in regular Building Conflation). Both buildings and the POI should all
conflate together. The extra names should be preserved in the "alt_name" tag, and the following types should be preserved: building=yes, 
man_made=works, and shop=department_store.
