Test to make sure roundabouts are conflated properly with the Unifying Roads alg. Roundabout 
removal/replacement is bypassed since we always keep reference geometries with Attribute Conflation. 

TODO: Note that the some of the roundabouts in the output do not merge. The Network Roads alg 
version of this test does not have this problem.
