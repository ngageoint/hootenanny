Test to make sure roundabouts are conflated properly with the Unifying Roads alg. Roundabout removal/replacement is bypassed since we always 
keep reference geometries with Attribute Conflation. 

TODO: Note that the direction of the roundabout road in the output is incorrect in sections and needs to be fixed. The Network Roads alg 
version of this test does not have this problem.
