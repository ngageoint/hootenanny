This is an Attribute Conflation test for ensuring that building height tags are preserved on building parts.

The input consists of a set of reference buildings, each with height tags, and a single secondary building with no height tag. The output 
should contain a building relation consisting of the reference geometries and preserving the individual height tags on each individual 
building part making up the relation. The building relation will have an outline member made up of a multipolygon relation containing all the 
reference geometries.
