This is an Attribute Conflation test to ensure many to one building matches with adjoining buildings merge correctly. 

There are six large building polygons in the second input, and each should match to a corresponding set of buildings in the first input. The 
individual building geometries in each group from the first input should be maintained in the output.  Note that the building match threshold 
has been dropped from the default value in order allow some of the buildings to merge.
