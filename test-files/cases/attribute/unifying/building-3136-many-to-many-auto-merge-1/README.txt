This is an Attribute Conflation test to ensure that any buildings involved in multiple matches are merged instead of reviewed (a review is 
the default hoot behavior in Reference Building Conflation). The three secondary buildings should merge into the two reference buildings and 
the duplicated tag with key "shop" should be preserved in the "alt_types" tag.
