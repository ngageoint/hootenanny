This is an Attribute Conflation test to ensure that any buildings involved in multiple matches are merged instead of reviewed (default hoot
behavior in regular Building Conflation). The three secondary buildings should merge into the two reference buildings and the duplicated tag
with key "shop" should be preserved in the "alt_types" tag.
