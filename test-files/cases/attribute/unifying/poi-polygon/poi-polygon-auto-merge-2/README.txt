This is the Attribute Conflation version of the same Reference Conflation Test. With the auto merge many poi to one poly matches setting only turned on, we expect both POIs to match and merge with the poly. The difference between this and the Reference version of the test is that the
secondary POI tags are favored over the reference building tags.
