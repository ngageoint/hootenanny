If you want to base your test configuration off one of the default configuration files, add the option "base.config" with the name of the
base configuration file as the value. If you do not specify a base configuration file, the base settings will be based off of the option
values in ConfigOptions.asciidoc.

To keep the test configuration files manageable, only add configuration options to your test config that differ in value from either those 
in your base configuration file (if you specified one) or ConfigOptions.asciidoc.

For larger config files, try to keep the configuration options in alphabetical order.
