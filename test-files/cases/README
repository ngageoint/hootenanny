test-files/cases contains a set of conflate case tests meant to test a specific aspect of a conflation algorithm against two small input
datasets. Basically if you find something hoot can't conflate, create one of these tests and try to fix the problem. Creating conflate case
tests is preferred for this type of testing over command tests, when possible.

Test configuration options inherit from each other from the top level parent directory on down.

If you want to base your test configuration off one or more of the default configuration files, add the option "base.config" with the name(s) 
of the base configuration file(s) as the value. Delimit multiple file names with a comma. At this time, all conf files should inherit from
at least Testing.conf and should have uuid.helper.repeatable=true (TODO: we should probably hardcode both of these). Optionally, setting
writer.include.debug.tags=true may aid in debugging.

To keep the test configuration files manageable, only add configuration options to your test config that differ in value from those in your 
base or next highest up parent configuration file. If your test only needs configuration options from its parent config, you don't need to 
create a configuration file for it.

When possible, only use match/merger creators specific to the type of conflation being performed by the test to increase test runtime 
performance (although, usually not an issue for normal small test files) and reduce dependencies on other matchers/mergers.

For larger config files, keep the configuration options in alphabetical order.
