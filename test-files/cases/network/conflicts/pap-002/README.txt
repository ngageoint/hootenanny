Mostly I'd like to see the square-shaped road arrangement at the intersection of Rue Tokyo and Rue Pean conflate without getting weird. This may be fantasy.

- Rue Tokyo should conflate along its entirety (doesn't quite).
- Road segment at the North of Rue Pean should conflate
- Rue Cheraquit should conflate
