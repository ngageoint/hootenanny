This tests to see that when duplicate overlapping roads with similar, but not exact tags, are removed by the DuplicateWayRemover post 
conflate op that the correct highway classifications are maintained. See the intersection of the group of roads tagged with 'note=check_me'.
The output 'highway=secondary' should have no break in continuity of its type tag.
