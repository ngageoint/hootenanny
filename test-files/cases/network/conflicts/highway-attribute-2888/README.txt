The test uses Attribute Conflation where attributes are copied from the secondary dataset to the reference dataset, but the geometries of 
features in the reference dataset are not modified.   

NOTE: Would like to make the input datasets smaller for test runtime performance purposes but had difficulty reproducing the desired 
result after cropping them down.
