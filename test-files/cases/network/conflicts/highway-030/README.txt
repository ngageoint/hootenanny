This one is tricky, because there are two instances of K St NW / US Hwy 29 in Input2.osm. Because the two roads are further apart than their circular errors, they don't get combined by the DuplicateWayRemover. Consequently, when conflated with Input1, you get two overlapping partial matches on the left side of the map, throwing two reviews.
