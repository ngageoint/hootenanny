This test ensure that house numbers are used for non-intersection address matching (this is also tested without address caching in 
AddressScoreExtractorTest). The ref shop=furniture named "Shopper's Choice" should review with the sec POI amenity=clinic name 
"Vida Pharmacy & Clinic" based on distance and should not match based on address.
