This tests that we favor a POI/Polygon match over a POI/POI review and that the POI/POI review doesn't keep the POI/Poly match from happening.
All the POI/Poly storage tanks matches should merge and any POI/POI reviews involving the merge storage tank POIs that existed before those
merges should be removed. See notes in poi-polygon-review-conflict-4331-1 as to other ways we could handle this.
