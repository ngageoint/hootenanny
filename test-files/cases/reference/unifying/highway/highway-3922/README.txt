This tests that highway=crossing nodes are transferred from secondary to reference ways during Reference Conflation with the Unifying Algorithm. 
All the crossing nodes from the secondary way should end up in the output at the location on the road, all way segments should be going in the
correct direction, and no partial offshoot segments should be added.
