This tests rail geometry matching of a particular section for a particular pair of features. The
reference output rail hoot:id=-98867041 (running from 31.2886499,30.0513161 to 31.2886746,30.0519013) 
should have a name tag transferred to it, and there should be no secondary feature portion near the
