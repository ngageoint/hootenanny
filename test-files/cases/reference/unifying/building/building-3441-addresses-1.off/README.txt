See note in BuildingConflateAddressTest to why this has temporarily been disabled.

This test checks for matches where there is an explicit disagreement in building address. When that 
happens, matches are downgraded to reviews. In the data, two of the six buildings are in address 
disagreement and should trigger a review.
