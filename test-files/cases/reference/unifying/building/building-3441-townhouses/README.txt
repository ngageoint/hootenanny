This test conflates a group of overlapping townhouses with another. Since the houses are adjoining, we need to be more picky about match 
criteria. In the case where a ref building matches two secondary buildings given the model output, we match only to the one with the most 
overlap and throw the other match out (overlap ties result in reviews). In this output, each of the six matching buildings should conflate
with one another.
