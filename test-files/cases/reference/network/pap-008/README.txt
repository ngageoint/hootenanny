"Avenue John Brown" in the reference should conflate cleanly with the corresponding unnamed road in the secondary. "Avenue Lamartini√®re" and 
"Rue Fernand" in the reference should conflate cleanly with the corresponding unnamed roads in the secondary. 

Zoom in very closely when checking for merges, otherwise its not obvious two of the roads didn't merge.

This test requires network.edge.match.set.finder.max.iterations to be set to 20 currently. Other tests will pass with the value as low
as 12. Unfortunately, this higher number of iterations contributes to a severe bottleneck in the algorithm performance for larger datasets.
