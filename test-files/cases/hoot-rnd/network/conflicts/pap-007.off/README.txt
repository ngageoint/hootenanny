Minus the divided highway stuff on the left side of the map, this should conflate pretty cleanly.

Right now I'm seeing an issue with the "P"-shaped part of Avenue Monseigneur Guilloux - it is not conflating like it should. Possible issue with sharp corners that maybe should be treated as intersections by the intersection splitter???
