In this case we have the ref dataset with a roundabout, and the secondary dataset with a more standard intersection. The roads should conflate cleanly, and be connected to the roundabout.

As things stand now, this conflation looks great -except that the roads on the West of the roundabout are not conflating. This is likely an issue with the conflicts network matcher.
