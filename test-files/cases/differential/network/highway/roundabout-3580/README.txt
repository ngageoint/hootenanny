This is an Differential Conflation test using the Network Roads Algorithm that attempts to ensure 
that a roundabout that matches between reference and secondary data is not passed through to output.

TODO: Note the differences in output between this and the Unifying version of the test. The Unifying
version output looks better. Bring them inline as part of #5063.
