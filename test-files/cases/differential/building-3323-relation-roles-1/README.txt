This is an Differential Conflation test to ensure that building multipolygon members do not have shared relation roles and that no invalid roles
are present. These errors were found with JOSM validation.

TODO: still working on this

The output should contain a single multipolygon relation made up of inner and outer roles only. None of the feature members should be repeated 
with different roles.
