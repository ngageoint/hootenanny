This tests the situation where a temporary roundabout connector is added but later is merged with another road section and its ID changes. Additional logic has been added in to make sure it is still deleted by ReplaceRoundabouts. See Homestead Boulevard.

Note: After addition of collection relation conflation, four reviews were added involving the "route 1" relation. These seem to be acceptable 
reviews, but that is questionable at this point and may require changing after we run the conflation of collection relations through more data.
