This tests to make sure that railway conflation doesn't leave any orphaned secondary features that belong to relations. See Linha do Oeste.
Since railway conflation uses the Unifying road merging algorithm, the fix employed by this test should work for road data as well.

Note the damage done to the route relation Linha do Oeste from the secondary layer is in. That needs to be fixed.
