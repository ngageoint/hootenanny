There are two building and one tower point. The tower lies on one of the 
buildings. Before fixing this problem the building with the tower was being
removed and the tower was being removed with it. Now the building is being 
removed and the tower remains. 

In this case the tower represents a minaret. If it was explictly called a
minaret then this would not need to be reviewed. Since it is marked as a tower
it should be reviewed.

NOTE: The tower is no longer part of the building after this change. It may
be more appropriate to make sure the tower stays as part of the building, but
that is some business logic that needs to be explored.
