This test checks to see that appropriate roads crossing polygons are flagged for review.

You should not see footways crossing parks or parking lots flagged for review (see the shorter Missipillion Riverwalk footway). You should not
see any roads that merely touch a building, etc. without crossing flagged for review, as that is probably just a minor mapping mistake
(see the longer Missipillion Riverwalk footway).

For the most part, highway=secondary and higher crossing buildings or parking lots are fair game to be flagged for review, and there are
three instances in the output (Foster Street, a short highway=service near the end of Foster Street, and Pearl Alley).
