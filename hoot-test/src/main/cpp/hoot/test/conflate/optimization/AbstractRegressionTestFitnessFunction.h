 * @brief The AbstractRegressionTestFitnessFunction class Fitness function which optimizes against
 * Hootenanny regression release test data.
 *
 * This class uses the error log setting to allow for more easily viewing the results of the
 * optimization without having to view conflation log clutter...there may be a better way to
 * handle this.
 *
 * At this time, this will only work against the network versions of the regression tests but
 * could easily be made to work against the unifying versions as well with some test refactoring.
