 * Does the element satisfy some crierion? If so, it'll return true.

 * The criterion could be just about anything. E.g.
 * - Distance to a point
 * - line length
 * - building type
 * - etc.
 *
 * How this criterion is used is based on the context. E.g. you could use it to delete all elements
 * that satisfy the criteria, or add tags to all those that meet the criteria. In general, you
 * should only use the criteria in a positive sense. (e.g. apply something to the elements that
 * meet the criteria, rather than apply it to those that don't meet the criteria). Look at the
 * NotCriterion for an example to negate criterion.
