 *  - All manually matched features have the MATCH#= tag where the value is the smallest ID in the
 *    cluster of matched features.
 *  - The inputs were conflated and the result is passed in as the conflated object.
 *
 * This has been designed for buildings and POIs, but not roads.
 *
 * I used MatchComparator as a starting point for this class. There are enough differences between
 * the two that it doesn't really make sense to combine them at this point. At some point it may
 * make sense to add all the functionality that is currently in MatchComparator to this class, but
 * not today.
 *
