/**
 * Returns a unique ID (internal to this instance) starting at 1. When the user is done allocating
 * IDs, call close and the specified sequence will be updated such that its value will be >= the
 * max value this reserver created + margin.
 *
 * This is most useful within the current_* tables where the node_id column must be unique for a
 * given map and we know that the services will not be modifying the map at the same time we're
 * creating new IDs. When this is done we have to make sure that services will only create new IDs
 * greater than the max ID we've assigned so we'll update the sequence. Updating the sequence is
 * not atomic, so by adding a margin of 10000 we're pretty much guaranteed that nothing will be
 * stomped on (10000 callers would have to call nextval between our currval and setval calls, very
 * unlikely).
 *
 * Limitations:
 *  - If somebody calls NEXTVAL *margin* times while close() is running then the sequence
 *    value will be too small and you'll get a duplicate ID error in the DB when inserting.
 *    Very unlikely.
 *  - If somebody calls SETVAL at anytime while close() is running all bets are off.
 *  - Whether or not it is needed the sequence will be incremented by at least 1 when close() is
 *    called.
