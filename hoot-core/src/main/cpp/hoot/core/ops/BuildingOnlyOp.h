 *
 * 1) Visits all elements in the map, and removes extreneous tags:
 *    OBJECTID
 *    PAGENUMBER
 *    SHAPE_ARE
 *    SHAPE_LENG
 *    hoot:layername
 *
 * 2) It converts tags "BUILDING=yes" to "building=yes"
 *
 * 3) It removes building relations where two outlines are joined by a shared
 *    way segment. (Note that it leave multipolygon relations alone)
