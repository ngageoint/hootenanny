/**
 * UFD Data frequently has buildings mapped out as individual parts where each part has a different
 * height. While they may represent a single building they're presented in the Shapefile as
 * individual rows.
 *
 * I would like to maintain the richness available in the data they've collected (gabled roofs,
 * heights on sections of buildings, etc). This is very applicable to the 3D mapping being done
 * in OSM. [1]
 *
 * This class implicitly merges the individual building parts into a single part. If two buildings
 * share two or more contiguous nodes and the relevant tags match then the parts will be merged
 * into a single building. In some cases this may not be desirable (think row houses in DC without
 * addresses), but it should yield reasonable results on a case by case basis.
 *
 * When multiple parts are merged the result is a building relation. All other elements are left
 * untouched.
 *
 * It is assumed that the data has been cleaned and redundent nodes and invalid ways have been
 * removed. It is also assumed that all buildings form closed polygons.
