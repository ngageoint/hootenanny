/**
 * A base class for setting a geospatial boundary on an object (used to be a base class but doesn't
 * seem to be causing any problems in inheritors due to MI). The exact meaning of setting the bounds
 * is context dependent. In the case of OsmMapOperation, for example, it limits the scope of the
 * operation. It is important to note that even if the rest of the operation in an implementation is
 * not in WGS84, the bounds itself will still be in WGS84.
 *
 * Currently from a config string we're only supporting Envelope and Polygon geometries (see
 * GeometryUtils::boundsFromString), but that could be expanded. For the implementations that
 * require the bounds to be a rectangular envelope, custom error checking should be added to their
 * configuration parsing to ensure an envelope string is passed in.
