 * A custom set of rules that allow for additional match tweaking beyond the additive model used
 * in PoiPolygonMatch.
 *
 * The logic in this class has been stripped down over time for maintainability purposes.
 * Currently, the logic accounts for adding one additional correct match in one test dataset.  Since
 * that number is so small and the logic is runtime expensive, its disabled by default.  Future
 * customization of this class may improve matching to the point that the logic should be
 * re-enabled.
