/**
 * This class is intended to reduce the number of unnecessary reviews between POI's and polygons
 * with the goal of never causing a miss where there should be a match.  Any rule that results in an
 * incorrect match found over the course of time testing against different datasets should be
 * removed from this class.
 *
 * This class is the result of disatisfaction with the overall high number of reviews generated by
 * poi/poly conflation and has had quite a bit added to it over time.  It would be nice to get rid
 * of most, if not all, of this class, as it can be difficult to maintain.  That may be possible via
 * modifications to the definition of what poi/poly conflation conflates, as well as modifications
 * to the evidence calculation in PoiPolygonMatch.  Alternatively, making another attempt at a
 * poi/poly random forest model could make it entirely obsolete (#2323).  At the very least,
 * triggersRule could benefit from being refactored into smaller chunks. - BDW
 *
 * This class was created almost entirely using the POI/Polygon regression test datasets C and D.
 * Unfortunately, the data found in those tests to warrant creating the review reduction rules
 * never had conflate case tests generated for them. This could eventually be done but will be
 * very tedious, as data for each separate test case must be tracked down individually from those
 * datasets.
