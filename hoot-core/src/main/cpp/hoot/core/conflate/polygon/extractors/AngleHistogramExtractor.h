/**
 * This idea was taken from JCS, but the code has been reimplemented to better take advantage
 * of the OSM schema.
 *
 * The angle histogram extractor works by calculating the angle of each line segment in a line
 * string and adding that angle to a histogram where the weight is the length of the line segment.
 * A histogram is built up in this way for both input lines, normalized and the difference
 * calculated. 16 bins are used in the histogram.
 *
 * 1 means the histograms have effectively no difference. 0 means they're completely different.
