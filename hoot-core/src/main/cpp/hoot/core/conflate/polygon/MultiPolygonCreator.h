/**
 * A work in progress. Only basic functionality exists. See #2115 for details.
 *
 * This will happily try to convert any relation into a multipolygon regardless of tags. It is the
 * caller's job to determine if this is appropriate or not.
 *
 * A best effort is made to detect bad polygons and throw an appropriate error, but there are
 * guaranteed to be outliers that will not be caught by Hoot and you may receive an invalid
 * geometry as a result. If there are no outer members then a valid empty geometry will be
 * returned.
 *
 * Hoot's interpretation of some ambiguous situations.
 * 1. If three or more ways of a single type meet at a end/start point then it is an error.
 * 2. A hole can only be a hole in one outer ring. If the hole is inside multiple outer rings
 *    it will put placed in the smallest outer ring that contains the hole.
 * 3. If multiple outer ways overlap it is an error.
 *
 * See the OSM wiki [1] for a detailed description of what constitutes a valid multipolygon and
 * how to compose complex objects.
 *
 * This is not very efficient for multipolygons with a large number of components (e.g. dozens
 * of inner and/or outer rings).
