    // from an API database query, for example, the default behavior is to return parent relations
    // and all their relation members for any data within the bounds (fully hydrated relations).
    // Without further geo filtering of such data, conflation may undesirably modify features
    // outside of the conflate bounds and encounter increased runtime due to conflation of extra
    // features. Turning off relation member hydration or trying to crop such data after its read
    // can lead to malformed relations in the conflated output. So, we set up a filter here to
    // perform a per features bounds check beyond the one done by the reader that populated the
    // input data. Input from certain readers actually does not fully hydrate relations, which makes
    // this check unnecessary. However, the check is done automatically anyway to keep the logic
    // simple and not tie it to input source type. The check really shouldn't slow things down too
    // much, though, if at all.

    // or in the constructor b/c a map is needed by it.
