/**
 * @brief The ConflateInfoCache class caches conflatable elements, their relationships with other
 * elements, and conflation configuration details that may aid in speeding up conflation jobs.
 *
 * This is generally expected to be initialized separately for each section of the code using it. It
 * is done this way rather than implementing a Singleton or using global static instances, since
 * conflate case tests are launched as multiple threads within the same process. Not using separate
 * instances of the cache which would result in a conflicted cache state if the cache was shared by
 * different threads (different elements with the same ID could have different info).
 *
 * The element property caches used within this class were determined on 9/30/18 running POI/Polygon
 * conflation against the regression test unifying-tests.child/somalia.child/somalia-test3.child and
 * also on 1/7/20 against the data in africom/somalia/229_Mogadishu_SOM_Translated. Caching is only
 * used where it has been proven in enhancing conflate runtime performance against real world data.
 * Further caching enhancements may be deemed necessary for conflation against other feature types.
 *
 * Its worth noting that if you are doing cache performance tweaks on a Vagrant VM, the runtimes may
 * vary somewhat widely with subsequent executions of the exact same conflate job. So in that case,
 * its best to look for tweaks with fairly large improvements and ignore those that show smaller
 * performance improvements.
 *
 * WARNING: This class can get extremely memory hungry depending on how the cache size is
 * configured.
 *
 * @todo We may be able to use thread_local storage for this purpose with static member vars and
 * avoid using separate instances
