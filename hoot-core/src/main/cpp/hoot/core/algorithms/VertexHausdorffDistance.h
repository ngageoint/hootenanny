/**
 * Implements algorithm for computing a distance metric
 * which can be thought of as the "Vertex Hausdorff Distance".
 * This is the Hausdorff distance restricted to vertices for
 * one of the geometries.
 * Also computes two points of the Geometries which are separated by the computed distance.
 * <p>
 * <b>NOTE: This algorithm does NOT compute the full Hausdorff distance correctly, but
 * an approximation that is correct for a large subset of useful cases.
 * One important part of this subset is Linestrings that are roughly parallel to each other,
 * and roughly equal in length - just what is needed for line matching.
