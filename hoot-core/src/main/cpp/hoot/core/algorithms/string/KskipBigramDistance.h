/** Work based on:
 *  A Closer Look at Skip-gram Modelling
 *  David Guthrie, Ben Allison, Wei Liu, Louise Guthrie, Yorick Wilks
 *  http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/ballison/pdf/lrec_skipgrams.pdf
 *
 *  NOTE: This algorithm isn't being used anywhere because tests on Geonames data showed
 *   that the Levenshtein distance outperformed or was equal to Skip-grams in 98.3% of the
 *   test cases.  The test were run as follows, Geonames data was used from four countries
 *   AF, AR, RU and US (http://download.geonames.org/export/dump/).  The test cases used only
 *   geonames POIs that contained alternate names to compare the original name against.  The
 *   first tests were run solely Skip-grams vs. Levenshtein and Skip-grams fared better on
 *   its own but when combined with other distance classes (ToEnglishTranslateStringDistance and
 *   MeanWordSetDistance) those results dropped off tremendously.  Since the Random Forest
 *   extractors apply both of those distances to Levenshtein, the test had to include them
 *   thus degrading and already degraded results.  So the ToEnglishTranslateStringDistance and
 *   MeanWordSetDistance classes were applied to both algorithms, counted, averaged, and
 *   reported.  Below is a sample of the data both before the two distance algorithms were
 *   applied and after:
