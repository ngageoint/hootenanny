/**
 * @brief The AngleHistogramExtractor class works by calculating the angle of each line segment in
 * a line string and adding that angle to a histogram where the weight is the length of the line
 * segment. A histogram is built up in this way for both input lines, normalized and the difference
 * calculated.
 *
 * 16 bins are used in the histogram. 1 means the histograms have effectively no difference. 0 means
 * they're completely different.
 *
 * This idea was taken from JCS, but the code has been reimplemented to better take advantage of the
 * OSM schema.
