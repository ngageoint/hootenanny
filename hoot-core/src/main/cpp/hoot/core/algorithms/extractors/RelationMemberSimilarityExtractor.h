 * @brief The RelationMemberSimilarityExtractor class scores how similar the members of two
 * relations are.
 *
 * It uses a Jaccard index which calculates a score in the range of 0.0 to 1.0. Since relations may
 * have similar members with different element IDs between reference and secondary layers, the
 * comparisons ignore element IDs and look at the member elements directly.
