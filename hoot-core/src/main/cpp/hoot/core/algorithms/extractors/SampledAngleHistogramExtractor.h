 * @brief The SampledAngleHistogramExtractor class is similar to AngleHistogramExtractor but has the
 * following differences:
 *
 * - The angle is sampled at a configurable distance along the way.
 * - The distance from the sampled location on the way to look to calculate the heading is
 *   configurable.
 * - A lower default value of bins is used for the histogram.
