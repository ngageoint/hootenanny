/**
 * A tag concept represents a single concept that is represented in one or more tags. By grouping
 * multiple tags into a single concept we can show that two or more tags that are required may
 * represent a single concept. For example:
 *
 * - public_transport=platform (a concept of a public platform)
 * - public_transport=platform;bus=yes (another more refined concept of above)
 * - public_transport=platform;railway=yes (another concept that isn't compatible with bus above)
 * - highway=road;bus=yes (another concept that isn't compatible with bus above)
 *
 * In the cases above just because one tag matches in the set doesn't mean that there is a
 * similarity. You must have both tags matching to adequately represent the concept.
 *
 * Alternatively some simple cases like highway=primary are sufficient in and of themselves.
