Please read the Hootenanny Developer's Guide for details on setting up an environment, coding standards, and development process.  Hootenanny 
developers use a customization of the [Gitflow workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#gitflow-workflow).
## Workflow Summary
* Open a GitHub issue for the new feature to be worked on.
* Perform work for the feature on a new git feature branch derived from the master branch and named with the number of the GitHub issue that was opened.
* Open a pull request to merge the feature branch into the master branch and assign at least one individual to review the changes before merging
