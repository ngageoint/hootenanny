Please read the Hootenanny Developer's Guide for details on setting up an environment, coding standards, and development process.  Hootenanny 
developers use a customization of the [Gitflow workflow](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows#gitflow-workflow).
## Workflow Summary
* Open a repository issue for the new feature to be worked on.
* Perform work for the feature on a new git feature branch named as the number of the issue opened.
* Open a pull request and assign at least one reviewer to merge the feature branch into the "develop" branch mainline when the 
feature is complete.
