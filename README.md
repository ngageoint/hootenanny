# Introduction

Hootenanny was developed to provide an open source, standards-based approach to geospatial vector data conflation. Hootenanny is designed to facilitate automated and semi-automated conflation of critical foundation GEOINT features in the topographic domain, namely roads (polylines), buildings (polygons), and points-of-interest (POI's) (points). Conflation happens at the dataset level, where the user's workflow determines the best reference dataset and source content, geometry and attributes, to transfer to the output map.

If you have any support questions please contact Hootenanny.Help@DigitalGlobe.com.

# Installing Hootenanny 

Hootenanny has been tested on both CentOS/RHEL 6.5 and Ubuntu 14.04. Ubuntu
14.04 receives more active development and more streamlined installation
instructions. Please see [Hootenanny - Developers
Guide.pdf](https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny/releases/download/v0.2.16/Hootenanny.-.Developer.Guide.pdf) for detailed instructions on Ubuntu 14.04. Both set of instructions are tailored to an audience that is deeply familiar with scripting and install procedures on Linux.

System Administrators who would like to install on CentOS/RHEL 6.5 should follow
the [Hootenanny - Installation
Instructions.pdf](https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny/releases/download/v0.2.16/Hootenanny.-.Installation.Instructions.pdf).

For those Ubuntu 14.04 users who wish to follow a more streamed-lined set of instructions, please refer to the Vagrant (VM container) set up instructions in the Developers Guide.  There is currently no Vagrant set up for CentOS/RHEL 6.5 so if you wish to use that environment please contact us at Hootenanny.Help@DigitalGlobe.com.
