# Introduction

Hootenanny is an open source conflation tool developed to facilitate automated and semi-automated conflation 
of critical Foundation GEOINT features in the topographic domain, namely: 
* POIs
* Building polygons
* Transportation polylines (highways, cart tracks, trails, bridges, and tunnels)
* Waterway polylines (hydrologic features such as rivers, streams, drainage, and ditches).

Conflation occurs at the dataset level, where the user’s workflow determines the best reference dataset and source content, geometry and attributes, to transfer to the output map.  Hootenanny's internal processing leverages the key value pair structure of OpenStreetMap (OSM) for improved utility and applicability to broader user groups, e.g. normalized attributes can be used to aid in feature matching and OSM’s free tagging system allows the map to include an unlimited number of attributes describing each feature. 

Hootenanny is developed under the open source General Public License (GPL) and maintained on the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency’s (NGA) GitHub [site](https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny).

Hootenanny is built upon the open source [Mapbox iD Editor](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD), which provides an intuitive and user-friendly conflation experience without the extra overhead of thick desktop GIS clients.  The application is primarily supported in either the Chrome or Chromium browser with more limited supported in Firefox.   

A REST API is in place to connect the web browser based User Interface (UI) with the core conflation algorithms and database.  The translation and conflation operations are also exposed through web service endpoints and the resulting vector data is accessible via an Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Web Feature Service (WFS) for additional open interoperability. 

If you have any support questions please create an issue in this repo or contact us via email: Hootenanny.Help@DigitalGlobe.com.

# Specifications

We actively maintain and update our [Frequently Asked Questions page](https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) 
so please refer to that page for any questions about general Hootenanny capabilities.

## Supported Data Formats
Hootenanny can import from:
* Shapefile (.shp)
* OpenStreetMap (.osm)
* ESRI File Geodatabase (.gdb)
* .zip files containing shapefiles and/or .gdb files
* geonames.org (.geonames)
* OSM API database via bounding box query

Hootenanny can export to: 
* Shapefile (.shp)
* OpenStreetMap (.osm)
* ESRI File Geodatabase (.gdb)
* Web Feature Service (WFS)
* OSM XML changeset file
* Directly to an OSM API database via SQL changeset

Note:
* .gdb, Shapefile, and OSM formats are exported as a zip file containing all of the relevant 
associated files
* WFS is exported as WFS Get Capabilities service URL that can be added into an OGC-enabled third party application

## Tag Schemas
Hootenanny leverages the OSM key value pair tag concept and PostgreSQL database structure to support translation between various data schemas.  By default, Hootenanny supports automated schema conversion between: 
* Topographic Data Store (TDS) v6.1/v4.0 
* Multi-National Geospatial Co-Production Program (MGCP)
* Geonames
* OSM
* user defined "custom" translations 

For custom translations, a specific mapping can be defined based on an uploaded dataset using a semi-automated Translation Assistant.  More detailed background on the translation capabilities of Hootenanny can be found in Hootenanny User Guide as well as specific examples from the UI in the Hootenanny User Interface Guide. These documents can accessed in your local Hootenanny instance in hoot/docs or on the [releases](https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny/releases) under each version e.g. hootenanny-0.2.22.tar.gz/docs. 

# Installation
Instructions to launch an Ubuntu Hootenanny virtual machine using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) may
be found [here](https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny/blob/master/VAGRANT.md).

An RPM based installation is also available for CentOS 6.7.

Optional file download:
* https://s3.amazonaws.com/hoot-rpms/support-files/words1.sqlite.bz2

Additional instructions for setting up a Hootenanny development environment may be found in the Hootenanny
Developer's Guide.

# Getting Started
Once installed and configured, Hootenanny can be accessed from a browser by opening the application URL.  http://localhost:port/hootenanny-id

* Note that the specific port designation can be configured from either the Vagrantfile (if using Vagrant installation approach) or from the Tomcat/conf/server.xml file.  

## Hootenanny User Interface Guide
The Hootenanny User Interface Guide contains all of the background required to walk through each functional 
component of the software.  Sample datasets can be acquired from the provided URLs in the guide or within the 
%HOOT_HOME/test-files directory.
