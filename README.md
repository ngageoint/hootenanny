# Introduction

Hootenanny is an open source conflation tool developed to facilitate automated and semi-automated conflation 
of critical Foundation GEOINT features in the topographic domain, namely roads (polylines), buildings (polygons), 
and points-of-interest (POI’s) (points). Conflation occurs at the dataset level, where the user’s workflow 
determines the best reference dataset and source content, geometry and attributes, to transfer to the output map. 
Hootenanny internal processing leverages the key value pair structure of OpenStreetMap (OSM) for improved utility 
and applicability to broader user groups, e.g. normalized attributes can be used to aid in feature matching and OSM’s 
free tagging system allows the map to include an unlimited number of attributes describing each feature.  Hootenanny 
is developed under the open source General Public License (GPL) and maintained on the National Geospatial-Intelligence 
Agency’s (NGA) GitHub [site](https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny).

Hootenanny is built upon the open source [Mapbox iD Editor](https://github.com/openstreetmap/iD) which provides an intuitive 
and user-friendly conflation experience without the extra overhead of thick desktop GIS clients. This offers several key 
benefits which include its open license allowing users to easily customize and add functionality, a robust editing capability 
originally targeted for interactive editing of OSM features, and a web service based architecture for integrating into SOA environments.  
A REST API is in place to connect the web browser based User Interface (UI) with the core conflation algorithms and database. 
The translation and conflation operations are also exposed through node.js service endpoints and the resulting vector data is accessible via an Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) Web Feature Service (WFS) for additional open 
interoperability. The application is primarily supported in either the Chrome or Chromium browser with limited supported in Firefox.  

If you have any support questions please create an Issue in this repo or contact us via email: Hootenanny.Help@DigitalGlobe.com.

# Specifications

We actively maintain and update our [Frequently Asked Questions page](https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny/wiki/Frequently-Asked-Questions) 
so please refer to that page for any questions about general Hootenanny capabilities.

## Conflation
Hootenanny currently supports the conflation of POIs, Building polygons, Transportation polylines (highways, cart tracks, trails, bridges, 
and tunnels), and Waterway polylines (hydrologic features such as rivers, streams, drainage, and ditches).   When conflating these features, 
it is important to note that conflation occurs between similar feature types (e.g. POI to POI, Building to Building, Transportation 
polyline to Transportation polyline, etc.).

## Supported Data Formats
_Import:_ Hootenanny can ingest from:
* Shapefile (.shp)
* OpenStreetMap (.osm)
* ESRI File Geodatabase (.gdb)
* .zip files containing shapefiles and/or .gdb files
* geonames.org (.geonames)
* OSM API database sources (MapEdit, etc.; experimental feature; see documentation for workflow)

_Export:_ Hootenanny can export to: 
* Shapefile (.shp)
* OpenStreetMap (.osm)
* ESRI File Geodatabase (.gdb)
* Web Feature Service (WFS)
* OSM API database (MapEdit, etc.; experimental feature; see documentation for workflow)

Note that .gdb, Shapefile, and OSM formats are exported as a zip file containing all of the relevant 
associated files, while WFS is exported as WFS Get Capabilities service URL that can be added into 
an OGC-enabled third party application, and OSM API database export is done with an OSM changeset
representing the before/after difference of conflated data.

## Tag Schemas
Hootenanny leverages the OSM key value pair tag concept and PostgreSQL database structure to support translation between various 
data schemas.  By default, Hootenanny supports automated schema conversion between Topographic Data Store (TDS) v6.1/v4.0, 
Multi-National Geospatial Co-Production Program (MGCP), Geonames, OSM, as well as user defined "custom" translations where a 
specific mapping can be defined based on an uploaded dataset using a semi-automated Translation Assistant.  More detailed 
background on the translation capabilities of Hootenanny can be found in Hootenanny User Guide as well as specific examples 
from the UI in the Hootenanny User Interface Guide. These documents can accessed in your local Hootenanny instance in hoot/docs 
or on the [releases](https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny/releases) under each version e.g. hootenanny-0.2.22.tar.gz/docs. 

# Installation
Instructions to launch a Hootenanny virtual machine using [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) may
be found [here](https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny/blob/master/VAGRANT.md).

Optional file download:
* https://s3.amazonaws.com/hoot-rpms/support-files/words1.sqlite.bz2

If you're compiling manually on CentOS, you'll need:
** https://github.com/ngageoint/hootenanny/releases/download/v0.2.16/geos-3.3.8-patched.tgz

Additional instructions for setting up a Hootenanny development environment may be found in the Hootenanny
Developer's Guide.

# Getting Started
Once installed and configured, Hootenanny can be accessed from a browser by opening the application URL.  http://localhost:port/hootenanny-id

* Note that the specific port designation can be configured from either the Vagrantfile (if using Vagrant installation approach) or from the Tomcat/conf/server.xml file.  

## Hootenanny User Interface Guide
The Hootenanny User Interface Guide contains all of the background required to walk through each functional 
component of the software.  Sample datasets can be acquired from the provided URLs in the guide or within the 
%HOOT_HOME/test-files directory.
